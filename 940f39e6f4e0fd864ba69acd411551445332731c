This brings back the old bug though, that if you use

  * vlc
  * a DVD
  * pipewire

Then vlc tells pipewire to play "auxiliary 0" and "auxiliary 1" and
you get a constant clicking noise, instead of actual audio.

  * using pulseaudio instead of pipewire does not have this issue
  * using mpv intead of vlc does not have this issue
  * using rtp:// or local-file.mkv instead of a DVD does not have this issue
  * telling vlc to play to alsa (not auto/pulseaudio) **AND** telling vlc that alsa's output should be 5.1 or 7.1 (not the default, stereo) does not have this issue

  * this is true even if the DVD itself is only has 2.0 audio, i.e. it is NOT limited to surround sound DVDs
