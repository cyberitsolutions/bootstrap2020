Host master
  HostName FIXME
  Port FIXME
  User root
  IdentityFile /etc/ssh/%r@%h.ecdsa

## FIXME: master must exist in the known hosts file.
## How are we gonna populate that?
## TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
  StrictHostKeyChecking=no
  UserKnownHostsFile=/srv/ssh.known_hosts

# NOTE: BatchMode & IPQoS are set in rsnapshot-BCP.conf (not here), as
#       during debugging we might connect to master interactively.
