// This is meant for kiosks in public spaces, so
// you can have e.g. airline checkin kiosk unattended, and
// if the end user finishes the interaction and walks off (without logging out),
// the kiosk will automatically refresh/logout after a minute.
//
// We do not need this functionality for PrisonPC, as
// we have an entire desktop running outside chromium, and
// that is also logged in.
// (And when I tried adding idle-auto-log-out to that, EVERYONE HATED it.)
