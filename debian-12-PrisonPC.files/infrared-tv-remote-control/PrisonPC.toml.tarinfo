    # 15:53 <twb> OK kmod gets installed into inmate SOE.
    # 15:54 <twb> Cannot see why it woul- oh maybe that happens when we switch to tiny-initramfs as part of purge-bad-packages.
    # 15:54 <twb> Seems unlikely.
    # 16:01 <twb> OK so "apt purge --autoremove amd64-microcode intel-microcode tiny-initramfs+ '?installed?name(plymouth)' initramfs-tools" removes kmod.
    # 16:02 <twb> But we actually want kmod still.  I think.
    # 16:06 <twb> kmod is the only difference between what is removed with stock kernel and with inmate kernel (--physical-only).
    # 16:08 <twb> udev uses libkmod2 so maybe it doesn't need the ACTUAL kmod package...
    # 16:08 <twb> I will patch it to stay for now just for debugging...
    #
    # 16:04 <twb> Can a kernel do insmod/modprobe without having kmod actually installed?
    # 16:04 <twb> i.e. does it have an internal equivalent
    # 16:04 <twb> I noticed when I switch from initramfs-tools to tiny-initramfs, kmod gets remove by --auto-remove, and I think I still need it
    # 16:05 <grawity> module loading is done by udev, and udev will use libkmod directly â€“ it hasn't been forking modprobe for quite a while now
    # 16:17 <twb> grawity: thanks I just sort-of worked that out myself looking at the dependencies
    # 16:18 <twb> My actual high-level problem is the IR TV RC isn't working, and I get "kernel: rc_core: Couldn't load IR protocol module ir-nec-decoder" and "kernel: rc_core: Couldn't load IR keymap rc-rc6-mce"
    # 16:18 <twb> But my first thing I tried was "lsmod" and "modprobe" and of course those are gone
    # 16:22 <twb> Here's what I'm seeing:

    # 16:22 <twb> It seems like whatever is loading the maps (udev?) is ignoring rc_maps.cfg?
    # 16:23 <twb> Oh according to my notes it used to say "IR keymap rc-rc6-mce not found" even when it IS working
    # 16:25 <twb> Looks like *either* reinstalling kmod, or running "ir-keytable -a /etc/rc_maps.cfg" by hand, fixed it.  Let me isolate that further...
    # 16:29 <twb> OK, yeah, kmod is still needed for some reason.
    # 16:34 <twb> grawity: AFAICT it's not literally calling modprobe here:
    #             https://sources.debian.org/src/v4l-utils/1.22.1-5/utils/keytable/
    #             Any idea why it'd need kmod?  This is on Debian 12.
    # 16:35 <twb> This is happening with a custom kernel (which is why kmod can be purged in the first place), but I can't think why that'd cause this weirdness.
