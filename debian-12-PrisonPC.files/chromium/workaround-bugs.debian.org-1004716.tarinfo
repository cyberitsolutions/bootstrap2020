# https://bugs.debian.org/1004716
# This issue still happens in Debian 12 / Chromium 116.
# This is only needed for
#     ~/.local/share/desktop-directories/chrome-apps.directory:Icon=chromium-browser
# As we never ended up using chrome://apps, this does not happen by default.
# The user can still opt-in to this (More Tools > Create shortcut).
