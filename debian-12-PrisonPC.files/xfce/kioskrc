# There are old XFCE documents from 2010 that claim XFCE has a "kiosk mode".
#     https://wiki.xfce.org/howto/kiosk_mode
#     https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-session/advanced#kiosk_mode
#
# THESE DOCUMENTS ARE LIES!
#
# The only entries that are still used are [xfce4-session] Shutdown= and SaveSession=.
# You can see that this is true from the actual source code:
#
#     https://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=xfce_kiosk_query&perpkg=1
#
# You can also see where an example was removed:

# Here is documentation about the replacement

# I am creating this file because this is the SECOND TIME IN ONE DECADE that XFCE's stale wiki has tricked me.
# It also tricked someone else on #xfce that was asking for help.
# Seriously -- FIX YOUR FUCKING WIKI.

# This option prevents users from clicking "Shut Down" or "Reboot" in the menu.
# The user can still choose "Log out" which on PrisonPC does a reboot.
# The user can still press the physical power button, which does a shutdown.
# (Probably it would trigger a prompt, if upower was installed.)
# [xfce4-session]
# Shutdown=root

# This option hides the checkbox "save my session" in the logout screen.
# "Save session" essentially just means if chromium is open when you logout,
# xfce4-session will try to /usr/share/applications/chromium.desktop on next login.
# In my opinion, this is not a very interesting thing to have.
# I will leave it in just because meh, I guess?
# [xfce4-session]
# SaveSession=root
