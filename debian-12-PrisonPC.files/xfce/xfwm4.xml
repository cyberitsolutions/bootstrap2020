         Is this a known issue with XFCE?
         I can reproduce this problem with Debian 11 / xfwm4=4.16.1-1.

         UPDATE: it is sufficient to change the vblank method?

         FIXME: does overriding the vblank_mode to fix GL VMs, break physical hosts?

         UPDATE: I tested this on one AIO in the lab and it showed pictures just fine.
         I also confirmed it could open TV and didn't e.g. have tearing issues.
