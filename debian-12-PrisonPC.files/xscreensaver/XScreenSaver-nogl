! NOTE: This must be set, even if empty, otherwise xscreensaver puts a 'Loading...' text on the middle of the screen **before** it captures the desktop image.
!       Which results in 'Loading...' permanently plastered across the middle of the screensaver
! This can be a local directory name, or the URL of an RSS or Atom feed.

! FIXME: Actually could we just make this run something like `timeout 15m ripples --root ; xfce4-session-logout --logout
! FIXME: I don't think this screensaver is visually distinct enough,
!        but it's the only base one that keeps the current desktop and doesn't make it unrecognisable.
! FIXME: Why doesn't `--grayscale` work?
