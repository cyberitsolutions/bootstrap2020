# NOTE: In Debian 11, we installed this into /usr/sbin/shutdown, and
#       it ran /sbin/shutdown as the underlying tool.
#       In Debian 12, usrmerge means those are the same path!
#       Therefore try using /usr/local/sbin/shutdown and see if
#       that path is found when SSHing in (with --ssh-server=openssh-server)...
