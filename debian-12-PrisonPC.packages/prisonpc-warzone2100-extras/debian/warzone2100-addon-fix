__doc__ = """ work around warzone2100 bug

We can place warzone2100 addons in
/usr/share/games/warzone2100/maps/X.wz and
/usr/share/games/warzone2100/mods/Y.wz.

Warzone2100 FINDS these files, but it READS from
~/.local/share/warzone2100-$VERSION/maps/X.wz and
~/.local/share/warzone2100-$VERSION/mods/Y.wz.
This is a bug in warzone2100.

As a workaround, symlink the latter to the former.

NOTE: this breaks map auto-download for online play.
PrisonPC does not allow online play, so we don't care.

UPDATE 2022: in Debian 11 / warzone2100 3.3, symlinking the whole directory no longer works.
I think the warzone2100 code is doing stat() instead of lstat(), so treating a symlink as "not a directory".
Let's try symlinking individual files.

UPDATE: all this bullshit IS still needed in Debian 12.
        The paths have changed slightly:

        WAS ~p123/.local/share/warzone2100-$VERSION/mods/global/ARmod_$VERSION.wz
        NOW ~p123/.local/share/warzone2100/mods/$VERSION/global/ARmod_$VERSION.wz

UPDATE: in warzone2100 3.x, we could create symlinks to files in /usr/.
        in warzone2100 4.x, they EXPLICITLY DISABLE following symlinks.
        I don't know why, but this means that for the high-res texture mode (ARmod_4.1.0.wz),
        we would have to copy the entire texture blob into each user's $HOME (instead of just symlinking it).
        This is clearly bonkers, so I give up - I am just going to drop the text mod entirely.

        This is what strace said (note "SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW"):
