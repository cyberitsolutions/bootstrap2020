prisonpc-warzone2100-addons (11.7) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Workaround https://bugs.debian.org/1005865
  * Fix regexp for new `warzone --version`.
  * Bump artrev2100 (HD textures) for compatibility with Warzone2100 3.3.
  * Upgrade packaging to make use of Debian 11 features.
  * Symlink individual .wz files.  Symlink parent dir is now broken upstream.
  * addons.wz2100.net has "maps", "mods", and "mod-maps".
    As at wz2100 3.1, there was no GUI to toggle mods on and off, so
    ignore all "mods" and "mod-maps".
    Only two addons were created since Oct 2017, and one is a mod.
    So don't even bother to check any of these maps again.
    Just keep the old list we had before.
