  * template_index_externs.patch: Fix FTBFS (Closes: #957707).
  * Set home directory to /run/prayer instead of /var/run/prayer on

  * Replace exim4 dependency with default-mta.
  * Install init script initially disabled instead of using an ENABLED

      and support for it is no longer enabled in OpenSSL by default.
  * Add missing lsb-base dependencies.

  * dlopen_templates.patch: Use MYCFLAGS (which is initialized to the
    value of CFLAGS from dpkg-buildflags in the Config file) instead of
    CFLAGS in templates/{src,cam,old}/Makefile (Closes: #715310, LP:
    #1201216). The --defsym options were lost when we let CDBS override
    CFLAGS in the previous upload.

  * New upstream release.
  * Refresh patches.
  * Drop dummy package prayer-templates.
  * No longer override CDBS overriding CFLAGS, thereby allowing hardening
    flags to be properly propagated. I think it caused internal include
    flags to be lost, but since at least 1.3.2 that's no longer the case.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4.
  * hurd.patch: Always define HAVE_SHADOW. The test for BSD4_4 seems
    bogus; it is defined on Hurd, but crypt(3) is available there.

  * ipv6_v6only.patch (new): Set the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option on
    AF_INET6 sockets; since Prayer by default enumerates available address
    families and calls bind() once for each, conflicts will occur
    otherwise (Closes: #607261).

  * Convert (trivially, since CDBS with quilt was already used) to source
    format 3.0 (quilt).
  * no_db_version_check.patch: Remove unnecessary and incorrect check that
    not only the major and minor version numbers of the current libdb are
    the same as at compile time, but also that the patch number is equal
    or greater, which should not be a concern (Closes: #592119).

    - Dropped kfreebsd.patch, clean_completely.patch, and
      manpage_error.patch; all incorporated upstream.
    * makefile_install_config.patch: Updated; some parts incorporated
      upstream.
  * prayer-templates-dev.install: Only template_structs.h and misc.h
    needed henceforth, since only those files are #included by compiled
    templates.
  * template_sdk.patch: The #include that templates/src/build_index.pl
    generates was not changed, though.
  * debian/Config, debian/control: Enable libtidy for HTML parsing and
    sanitisation, fixing certain XSS problems, which were due to simple
    substring matching being used.
  * prayer.init, prayer-accountd.init: Add $remote_fs to, and move
    $local_fs to, Required-Start.
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.9.0:

prayer (1.3.2-dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dlopen_templates.patch:
    * templates/{cam,old}/Makefile: Define the symbols template_map and
      template_map_count as aliases to the template_$(TYPE)_map and
      template_$(TYPE)_map_count when linking, so that template libraries
      can be loaded by other names than the original one. Also remove some 
      cruft.
    * shared/dlopen_templates.c: Use those symbols instead.
  * Add symlinks so that template_set = xhtml_strict will still work.
  * Update the names of the directories for locally modified templates
    (under /etc/prayer/templates) to reflect the new template names.
  * template_sdk.patch (new): Create makefile for building template set
    libraries. Install it together with binaries and scripts needed.
  * Rename prayer-templates as prayer-templates-src and add new binary
    package prayer-templates-dev containing the aforementioned
    template-building tools as well as a README.Debian explaining how to
    use it all.
  * Ship NEWS.Debian only in the prayer package. Ship TEMPLATES in
    prayer-templates-src in addition to prayer-templates-dev.

      see NEWS.Debian for more information.
    - Repacked without University of Cambridge logos with dubious
      copyright/license status (more info in debian/copyright).
    - unbrand_cam_template.patch: Remove said Cambridge-specific graphics

      usernames_with_at.patch (incorporated upstream).

  * Make Prayer work on kFreeBSD.  Unfortunately there is no support for
    SysV semaphores.

      semtimedop is a stub.
    * debian/Config: Add -lutils to LIBS.
    * makefile_install_config.patch: put back a default value for
      lock_dir.
  * makefile_install_config.patch: Set imap_server to localhost/notls in
    default prayer.cf (Closes: #531801).
  * Depend on exim4 | mail-transport-agent.
  * Increase Standards-Version to 3.8.3.

prayer (1.2.2.1-7) unstable; urgency=high

  * Since /var/run can be a tmpfs filesystem, don't ship /var/run/prayer
    as part of the package but create it in the init script (LP: #304071).
    Also, var_prefix, pid_dir and prayer_user will by default be overriden
    from the command line to make sure that they get the values expected by
    the init script.

prayer (1.2.2.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * prayer.init: Correctly check for the presence of the executables.
  * Split out templates to a separate arch-indep package.
  * Change the default value of the tmp_dir option back to
    ${var_prefix}/tmp (/var/run/prayer/tmp) because using /tmp may not be
    secure.
  * usernames_with_at.patch (new, from upstream CVS): If a username
    contains an @, it will be assumed to be a valid email address and be
    used as envelope sender address and default "From" address when
    sending mail (Closes: #497016).

  * Urgency medium since fixing fairly serious bug(s).
  * debian/Config: Fix handling of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS from the
    environment or command line, breaking a circular definition of
    LDFLAGS (FTBFS on Ubuntu; LP: #256220).
  * unlimit_login_username.patch (new):
    - servers/prayer_login.c: Remove 8 character username limit from login
      form (Closes: #494517).
  * prayer.init, prayer-accountd.init: Sleep 1 second between stop and
    start in restart.
  * Add manpages prayer(8), prayer-session(8), prayer.cf(5), and
    prayer-ssl-prune(8) (groff-mdoc format). Remove half-done Docbook
    versions from source package.

 -- Magnus Holmgren <holmgren@debian.org>  Sun, 17 Aug 2008 17:38:00 +0200

prayer (1.2.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * welcome_is_template.patch: 
    - shared/config.c: Don't require that the help_dir option, which was
      removed from the default prayer.cf earlier, is defined
      (Closes: #493009).
  * makefile_install_config.patch: 
    - shared/config.c: Likewise don't check for lock_dir (Closes: #494011).

  * Acknowledge NMU, but change the build dependency to

prayer (1.2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release featuring XHTML templates and fixes to various
    bugs created by the reorganisation.
    - Drop accountd_makefile_typo.patch; fixed upstream.
  * makefile_install_config.patch: Changes to the default config: 
    - Disable SSL session caching.  
    - Clean out "direct connection stuff". Remove lock_dir since we use
      SysV semaphores.
    * Point login_prefix_path, motd_path, and login_suffix_path towards
      /etc/prayer.
    * Change postponed-mail and sent-mail to Drafts and Sent.
  * Improve SSL/TLS configuration:
    * makefile_install_config.patch: Point ssl_cert_file and
      ssl_privatekey_file to /etc/ssl/*/ssl-cert-snakeoil.*.
    + Add dependency on ssl-cert (>= 1.0.11).  
    + prayer.postinst: Add prayer to group ssl-cert on fresh install or
      when upgrading from versions prior to this one.
  * welcome_is_template.patch (new): Although the welcome screen is now a
    template among others, cmd_welcome.c still tried to read the file
    specified by welcome_path (welcome.html by default) and wouldn't show
    the welcome screen if the option was unset or the file couldn't be
    read. This patch removes that check as well as the welcome_path and
    help_path options from prayer.cf.
  * No longer install welcome.html (see above) and motd.html (no real
    content) in /etc/prayer. Install login_prefix.html, login_suffix.html,
    and motd.html (the versions found in files/etc.hermes in the
    distribution tarball) in /usr/share/doc/prayer/examples instead.
  * Do not install prayer-chroot (too experimental, hardcoded chroot path)
    or prayer-sem-prune (does nothing that ipcrm cannot do).
  * templates_fallback_to_compiled.patch (new): If the
    template_use_compiled option is false, nevertheless use compiled-in
    templates in template_expand.c if the requested template cannot be
    found on disk. Change default template_path to /etc/prayer/templates.
    Install said directory as well as subdirectories for available
    template sets.
  * Update and improve README.Debian.
  * Add logrotate dependency.
  * makefile_install_config.patch: Remove call to install.sh from
    files/Makefile and replace it with single tar pipeline; thus
    install.sh no longer needs to be patched.
  * remove_old_db_logfiles_from_prayer-ssl-prune.patch (new): Patch
    myarchive() in lib/mydb_db3.c so that it only deletes obsolete
    transaction logs if dirname = NULL, then call it (via DB->archive())
    from ssl_prune_sessions() in lib/ssl.c.
    - prayer-db-prune thus unnecessary.
  * template_find_bug.patch (new): Fix segfault in template_find() when
    template_set specifies a non-existing set. Also update default set.

    template system.
    - Drop obsolete folder_list_cosmetics.patch and includes.patch.
    - Note: SSL support has been removed from prayer-accountd for now.
  * Changed defaults (manual intervention may be needed):
    - Let prayer-accountd.pid reside in /var/run; letting the two packages
      share /var/run/prayer caused too much trouble.
    - prayer.cf (makefile_install_config.patch and debian/Config):
      var_prefix set to /var/run/prayer and referred to in other
      settings. socket_split_dir disabled by default and default sockets
      directory changed to /var/run/prayer/sockets.
  * debian/control:
    + Build-depend on latest Berkley DB library (libdb-dev).
    + Add Homepage field.
  * repair_ssl_session_db_on_version_mismatch.patch: Recreate session DB
    environment when upgrading from a version of Prayer that used an older
    BDB library.
  * prayer.postinst: Set HOME of prayer user to /var/run/prayer.
  * prayer.postrm: Simply remove /var/run/prayer (since accountd doesn't use it)
    on remove or disappear and correctly remove statoverrides (Closes: #483176).
    Also check that deluser exists; it may be gone at purge time.
  * Package build details:
    - Reduce makefile_install_config.patch by not changing BROOT into DESTDIR.
    - Override CDBS overriding CFLAGS.
  * debian/patches/accountd_makefile_typo.patch: Fix typo that caused PAM
    not to be used.

    exception has been granted.
  * Don't require cdbs 0.4.27-1. Oldstable has 0.4.28-1.

  * New maintainer email address.
  * Update README.Debian, removing lies about TLS not being possible to
    disable (Closes: #440462).
  * folder_list_cosmetics.patch: Remove space between expand/collapse
