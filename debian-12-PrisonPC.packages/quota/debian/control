Description: disk quota management tools
 Linux in-kernel NFS4 server/client does not implement quota opcodes.
 Therefore even though we're NFSv4-only (2049/tcp), we need NFSv3 rpc.quotad.
 That means rpc.quotad on the server, and quota(1) on the client, and
 hard-code the port on the server, and whitelist that port in the firewalls (and guestfwd).

 .
 The regular Debian "quota" package is 99% server-side stuff we DO NOT WANT.
 Provide an alternate Debian packaging that builds ONLY the quota binary.
 In particular, this avoids pulling in the ext2/3/4 userspace driver.
 It also avoids a bunch of garbage we do not care about, but
 is mostly harmless (e.g. warnquota, quotaon, quotacheck).
