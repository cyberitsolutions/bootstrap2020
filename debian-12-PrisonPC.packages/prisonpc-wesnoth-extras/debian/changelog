prisonpc-wesnoth-addons (11.2) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Target Debian 11 and Wesnoth 1.14.

  * Now debian/ is a not a single blobby shell script,
    split the policy decision (addons.ini) from
    the download/unpack mechanism (rules.py).

  * Disable pngcrush/jpegoptim/hardlink for now.
    The size savings were minor, pngcrush is slow (especially for 2000MB!).
    Also lintian now bitches about hard links, and
    squashfs will dedup them anyway.

  * Move all addons from pass/fail/todo back into a flat todo list.
    Also use the upstream list for 1.14 (not 1.12).

    Installing all 232 addons costs ~2000MB!  It took ages!
    Installing only 100 addons costs ~100MB.
    I picked the "first" 100 addons, sorted by (downloads per day - megabytes).
    That is basically "popularity" with a small penalty for really big addons.

    At least one initially-allowed addon DOES NOT WORK because
    it needs an initially-skipped addon.
    Someone needs to actually review addons.  Like... at all.

  * Force music to be installed, cost 160MB.
    In Debian 9 we felt that we excessive.
    In Debian 11 we are to old and tired to care anymore.
    supertuxkart's 1500MB cost has broken us.
