# Based on https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky-plugins
# NOTE: To get *ALL* plugins is 1.3GiB (as at November 2024), which is definitely WAY too much.
#       As a baseline, the main game itself is 0.25GiB.

# UPDATE: Only works if you make a NEW character while this plugin is loaded.
#         To actually find it, you have to know to do "I" key, then click "Logbook".
#         If you know enough to find that, you probably don't need help...
#         It's the same set of tutorial popups that appear in-game contextually as needed.
#         e.g. "what do do when you run out of fuel" appears when you first run out of fuel.
