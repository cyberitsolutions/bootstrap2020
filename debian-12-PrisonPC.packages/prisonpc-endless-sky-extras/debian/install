# NOTE: debian/plugins.txt refers to plugins by the value in <plugin>/plugin.txt:name, e.g.
#       https://github.com/endless-sky/all-content-plugin/blob/master/plugin.txt#L1
#       is "All-Content Plugin" *NOT* all-content-plugin.
#       UPDATE: some plugins have no plugins.txt, in which case the dir name IS used.
