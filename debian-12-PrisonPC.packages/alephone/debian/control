Description: FPS engine for the Marathon Trilogy
 Aleph One is a first-person shooter engine based on Bungie's Marathon 2:
 Durandal.  It features software and OpenGL rendering, Internet play, Lua
 scripting, and much more.
 .
 Play requires both the engine (this package) and a "scenario" (the game data).
 Debian does not distribute scenarios, but they can be downloaded gratis from
 Bungie's website or using the game-data-packager system.
 .
 Internet play is (hopefully) disabled in this for-PrisonPC build.

Description: sci-fi fps series
 The Marathon Trilogy is a science fiction first-person shooter video game series from Bungie.
 The name Marathon is derived from the giant interstellar colony ship that provides the setting for the first game;
 the ship is constructed out of what used to be the Martian moon Deimos.
 The three games in the series — Marathon (1994), Marathon 2: Durandal (1995), and Marathon Infinity (1996) —
 are widely regarded as spiritual predecessors of Bungie's Halo series.
 .
 This is a metapackage that simply depends on the engine and all three games.
