  sshd: use dropbear (not openssh) [#32544]
parents:

  # FIXME: THIS DOES NOT WORK.
  #        We can't simply append to the include list such that
  #           apt install openssh-server openssh-server- dropbear-run
  #        Because this happens:
  #           $ mmdebstrap sid /dev/null --include='mg mg-'
  #           Package 'mg' is not installed, so not removed
  #           The following NEW packages will be installed: â€¦
  #           The following held packages will be changed: mg
  #           E: Held packages were changed and -y was used without --allow-change-held-packages.
