#   drivers/firewire
#   drivers/infiniband
#   drivers/mmc
#   drivers/nvme
#   drivers/scsi

# Reduces overall build time slightly.
# Reduces overall attack surface slightly (for PrisonPC).

## With any of these, PXE boot fails.
# MODULES=list
# BUSYBOX=n

## With these, PXE boot works.
MODULES=netboot                 # 21% faster 23% smaller
FSTYPE=nfs                      # doesn't help; doesn't hurt
RESUME=none                     # doesn't help; doesn't hurt
BOOT=live                       # doesn't help; doesn't hurt
