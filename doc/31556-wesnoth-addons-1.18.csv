Plot and dialogue is mostly unchanged, you can play this campaign if you haven't played the original one, but, naturally, there are obvious deviations from the mainline lore. Translations for the most part of the campaign are used from the mainline.

Heavily influenced by the addons “Invasion from the Unknown” and “After the Storm”.

Music addons “Invasion from the Unknown Music” and “After the Storm Music” are recommended for a better atmosphere of epicness.

The Orc invasion came without warning and with a brutality that caught the Human Alliance completely off guard and unprepared for. Before the year was over the Orcs controlled half of the Northland. The Winter finally halted their advance. Meh, what's the big deal. I never cared much for politics or policy. But when my uncle was gone, I started into the greatest adventure of my life.

This campaign is a classical rpg that offers a variety of options, you will just control one hero and bring him to fortune. You can trade, pickpocket, be a bard, bounty- or treasurehunter, or working as a craftsman selling your goods. You can also run a building and upgrade it or doing random generated missions. There are a lot of ways to make a fortune. But the world around isn't always friendly and it will react on your character level. You might encounter thieves, orcs, bandits or wild animals and therefore you will need a proper equipment to defend yourself.

Equip your charcter with: helmets, armors, shoes, shields, instruments, rings, amulets, ranged or meleeweapons or learn more than 80 powerful spells to gain an advantage. Hire one of 35 mercs to defend your load and recall them using your warhorn. Try to conquer an enemy town to gain a constant tax income. Encounter all kind of enemies each on changing maps, according to the terrain - even your ship might be attacked by naga warriors or dangerous pirates. Follow the storyline with 34 missions that will force you to explore the world of Strange legacy. A new amla system will allow you to create a character in the way you like him, allowing you to solve the game differently each time you play and the difficulty is increasing with each level up. 
For the most recent changes check the forum thread. Equip your uncles house with furniture allowing you to craft weapons, armors and cook food. If you like to have a classic RPG try out the RPG Mode. Have fun!

SXRPG,29306154,1715440367,92,campaign,6.0.5b,,"SX RPG ADDON is a stand-alone multiplayer ADD ON for Battle of Wesnoth.

!!Doza min doza teye!!!

What does SX mean:
-----------------------------------

Originally SX meant --Survival Extreme-- which became throughout the history of wesnoth-add-ons a synomyn
for maps that feature stand-alone-Heroes, that can be upgraded in so-called --shops--, fighting against an army of creeps,
which constantly increase in strengh while the game proceed. For killing creeps players are granted with gold, that
is used on their side to upgrade their heroes as well, to keep up with stonger creeps and to finally kill the ai leaders.
Gold from killing creeps will be generally given to ALL players. So no matter who kills the creeps, its always a good thing.

A major fun factor is that players gain additional temporary moves and attacks from killing enemy units,
so they are able to perform well planned killing streaks that bring even more gold to the players.

In order to win, players had to kill all enemy leaders, which were boosted in strengh greatly.
Players need to grow stronger from killing creeps and/or find gold from other sources to achieve this goal.
All 10ish turn ai als release a batch of bosses, exceptional strong units, which need some teamplay to win against,
or a very well developed single hero.


SXRPG ADDON:
--------------------------------

Featuring SXgameplay with RPG elements.

While SX is a basic hack-n-slay rpg-like approach, which attracted many players,
SXRPG features elaborated maps, adding adventure and dungeon-exploring gameplay to it.

On Top of the already existing differences among the different units,
SXRPG adds 6 classes of Warriors, Clerics, Rangers, Mages,
Rogues and Roguemages all with different strenghs and weaknesses.

It contains so far 6 elaborated Maps/Scenarios which need 80 to 120 turn to finish in average.
Each scenerio in this ADD ON is an adventure for 1 - 5 players. Any number of Players is welcome.

Less players means more Gold for each player to get started with. While less players get more gold at start,
but it is obvious that more players means more total income, since all players get the gold for killing creeps.

As a special Feature you can define the -Starting Level- in -advanced Options- in Game-Creation-Menu,
default is 0, but for more elaborated starting-Heroes you can chose higher Starting Levels.
The higher the starting Level, the higher the starting gold, but all enemies also rise accordingly
to the Level. I.E.: on lvl-0-start mobs start also at lvl 0, at lvl-4-start mobs start at lvl 4.
(Level is NOT the default level of wesnoth units, instead a sx-dependent measure for stat multipliers)
Starting at different Levels may change the Gaming Expierience and Gameplay.

This Map-Pack also features new units, new terrain, theres an additional soundfile.
The stuff included was mostly done by parts of the wesnoth-community and hopefully put to good use here.
Credits goes out to all who find their work here implemented. Thx to all contributors.

Big thx to all playtesters and people who gave suggestions. Many things implemented were suggested by
players and without these ideas SXRPG would be a lot different. :)

Have Fun.

The Turmoil of Asheviere…

The isolated populace of the Estmark Mountains are known for their warrior prowess and for their military academy at Estlyn. Asheviere, desiring to use these warriors to strengthen her hold on the throne, sent emissaries in an attempt to gain their aid. The proud people of the Estmarks declined to join Asheviere, and the Dark Queen would soon respond with an answer of her own...

Play as these proud Humans from the Estmarks, resist against Queen Asheviere, and discover the legacy of the Esterian people. All the while, as mortal forces clash in combat, an unseen force seeks release from her prison...

Features:
-- A Planned 7 Scenario Loyalist campaign, with story interludes. (2 Scenarios, 1 Interlude Ready)
-- Emphasis on Story and Characters, with custom traits to make the characters more unique!
-- Custom music from the UMC Music Books.
-- A focus on higher level units. All of the player's units are level 2 or higher!
-- Limited forces. You cannot recruit new units for this campaign, only recall!
-- 3 Planned Massive Battle Engagements (Scenario One, Four, and Seven)

Note: This addon includes some UMC music, which is included in this campaign. This is why the file size is relatively large.
Note 2: For detailed patch notes, please visit the forum thread.

Version 0.16.2
- Ported over to 1.18.
-- Estlyn Interlude included. Scenario Three playable, but not fully finished.

(Intermediate level, 18 scenarios, 4 dialogue only, work in progress)


This campaign includes several hundred custom units most of which were taken from (or derived from) the Reign of the Lords Era add-on by The_Gnat and some of the mainline campaigns. A huge thanks goes to The_Gnat for letting me use his fantastic Era for this campaign. I highly recommend trying out the Reign of the Lords add-on for yourself.

This campaign shall see you fight with, and against, a wide variety of factions with changing objectives and use of custom items you can find in certain scenarios. With custom units providing a wide range of choices of advancements for your units, and unique AMLAs for certain heroes, you should not worry about running out of ways to strengthen your army.

This campaign includes repeated references to mainline campaign lore, so it is recommended (although not strictly necessary) to first play Northern Rebirth and Eastern Invasion. There are also some minor references to The Legend of Wesmere, Heir to the Throne, and Delfador's Memoirs.

This is a work in progress released for Pre-Alpha testing.

This campaign is partly translated to Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) up to and including Scenario 11 thanks to the efforts of ERROR1025 (thank you for your contributions).

Note: All future updates will occur on version 1.18 of the Wesnoth add-on server.

Hoping that no one will feel offended, hurted, wounded or distraught by the 'nostalgic' exhumation of some old units, I wish you all a lot of fun.
