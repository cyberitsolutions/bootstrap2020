Background
==========

Normally a Debian Live system does several independent DHCP DORA bringups:

* the PXE ROM does one.
* the live-boot ramdisk does one using ipconfig (from klibc-utils).
* the root filesystem does one,
  and keeps running in the background to deal with lease expiry.

Because under PrisonPC all DHCP allocations are "fixed" by TCA,
we don't bother with the third step.  When the lease expires,
the desktop just keeps using the address.

At first this was an accident,
later we kept it because fixing it was nontrivial.


There are some problems with this approach:

* the Understudy SOE is sometimes deployed outside of PrisonPC.
* tca can reallocate the address to a new host [FIXME: task number]
* we have to hard-code the NTP server hostname,
  instead of getting it from DHCP.

So we'd like to fix this eventually.


Problem
=======

Originally we used isc-dhcp-server.  ISC is always terrible.

In Debian 7 we wanted to use busybox udhcpc instead, (#23324)
because busybox is already there, and it's simple and it works.
EXCEPT there were problems with ifupdown integration.

In Debian 8 we want to use systemd-networkd instead, (#30134)
because it's already there and PREPARE TO BE ASSIMILATED.
EXCEPT it doesn't work because of #23221 (Vendor Class check),
which requires VendorClassIdentifier from systemd v216+ (jessie has v215).

WARNING: v216+ changed a lot of this code;
it also also needs at least UseDomains=yes.


What happens if there's multiple ethernet cards plugged in?

When booting off the network,
live-boot 3 (wheezy) & 4 (jessie) are *SUPPOSED TO* configure
/etc/network/interfaces to use a static address on the configured interface.
I don't think they ever actually DID that.



Draft Implementation
====================

I think systemd-networkd is enabled by default, so we *don't* need to do this::

    chroot $t systemctl enable systemd-networkd

We *do* need tell it to perform DHCP, or it just logs NO-/CARRIER status. ::

    >$t/etc/systemd/network/live.network    printf %s\\n [Match] 'Name=eth[0-9]*'  [Network] DHCP=v4  [DHCP] CriticalConnection=yes UseMTU=yes

In theory with that, we can also remove::

    >$t/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf          printf %s\\n [Time] Servers=ntp


.. WARNING:: This WILL NOT WORK if you have multiple NICs cabled.
   In that case, you can get BOOTIF= from /proc/cmdline and add
   mangle that into a [Match] MACAddress line, which *MUST* be in
   de:ad:be:ef:ba:be format.

.. WARNING:: even then, systemd-networkd won't flush the addresses &
   routes already on the link, before doing a DHCP.  Not sure yet if
   this is a serious problem.


Test Results
============

Key points:

* when a PrisonPC client boots,
  it should get its hostname and DNS domain name from DHCP.

  This is working even systemd-networkd masked (completely disabled),
  I can't find the code that's doing this.
  Something (ipconfig?) creates /run/net-eth0.conf with the right hostname in it.

  Should it also set up /etc/hostname & /etc/hosts?
  This appears to be unnecessary now.

* when alpha-understudy boots,
  it should *SEND* the hostname,
  so that dnsmasq on alpha adds it,
  and other hosts can refer to it by name.

  I tested a generic boot with systemd-networkd enabled (and live.network configured),
  with no /etc/ethers & /etc/hosts entries on the dnsmasq side.
  The hostname stayed "localhost".

  Creating these files at build time didn't help::

    >$t/etc/hostname echo disappointingly-cicadae
    >$t/etc/sysctl.d/hostname.conf echo kernel/hostname=pullover-defers

  Shortly *after* systemd-networkd started, the logs all changed to pullover-defers,
  but dnsmasq didn't have an A record for either name, nor a PTR for the IP address.
  (Which makes sense, because tcpdump showed systemd-networkd didn't send-hostname.)

  If I "systemctl restart systemd-networkd" with the above, I see::

    Nov 20 18:39:55 pullover-defers systemd-networkd[469]: eth0 : Not connected to system bus, ignoring transient hostname.

  What if we do one of those things in the ramdisk, before systemd starts?

  Change "panic=10" to "break".
  At the (initramfs) prompt, "hostname pounding-gobble" then Ctrl+D.
  Once the login prompt appears, "ping pounding-gobble" from server works!

* Without setting an explicit NTP server in timesyncd.conf,
  with systemd-networkd off, it tries & fails to reach Debian NTP servers.

  With systemd-networkd *on*, and dnsmasq allowing the requests,

* From RTFS, as at v215, it looks like
  systemd-networkd will ALWAYS use the NTP servers suggested by the DHCP server.
  systemd-networkd will ALWAYS send the hostname to the DHCP server.

  *BUT*!  With live.network configured and *without* Server=ntp, even
  after the network is up, timesyncd continues to try to talk to
  Debian NTP servers instead of the one offered by dnsmasq (dhcp-option=42,0.0.0.0).



Understudy tests
----------------

* With [Match] Name=eth[0-9]*, if you plug in a second NIC,
  they BOTH come up and you get conflicting routes.

* With [Match] MACAddress=... taken from BOOTIF,
  only the boot NIC comes up, but you get this::

    $ ssh login,203.7.155.174 busybox ip r
    default via 203.7.155.129 dev eth0
    default via 203.7.155.129 dev eth0  metric 1024
    203.7.155.128/26 dev eth0  src 203.7.155.174
    203.7.155.129 dev eth0  metric 1024

* With [Match] MACAddress=... taken from BOOTIF,
  AND "ip a flush up" before switch_root,
  you get this::

    $ ssh root@login,alpha-understudy busybox ip r
    default via 203.7.155.129 dev eth0  metric 1024
    203.7.155.128/26 dev eth0  src 203.7.155.174
    203.7.155.129 dev eth0  metric 1024
