.. IMPORTANT::

   The rootfs will JUST WORK,
   because /usr/lib/klibc/bin/nfsmount mounts the rootfs,
   and it hard-codes the ports (no rpcbind) and doesn't lock (no rpc.statd).

   This is about problems mounting /home & /srv.
   For those we WANT locking and we NEED quota querying. (FIXME: right?)




THE PROBLEM
====================

Using stock jessie configuration, rpcbind isn't started at boot::

    systemd[1]: Job rpcbind.service/start deleted to break ordering cycle starting with basic.target/start

This is:

    https://bugs.debian.org/748074

NFS packages in Debian Jessie use sysv jobs.
NFS packages in Ubuntu Wily use backported systemd units, from NFS git.

    http://git.linux-nfs.org/?p=steved/nfs-utils.git;a=tree;f=systemd

rpcbind upstream doesn't include any init code at all.
rpcbind 0.2.3+ uses sd_notify.

MINIMAL FIX
====================

We're using NFSv3 because it's what we know.
We'll consider NFSv4 after upgrading the server from lucid to jessie.

For an NFSv3 client mount with locking, we need rpcbind & rpc.statd.
We do NOT need:

* rpc_pipefs  (for v4 & krb)
* rpc.idmapd  (for v4)
* rpc.gssd    (for krb)
* rpc.rquotad (for server)

If we do not start rpc.statd explicitly,
nfsmount(8nfs-utils) will run /usr/sbin/start-statd which is essentially::

    exec rpc.statd --no-notify     # in Debian, or

    systemctl rpc.statd start ||   # in Ubuntu & git
    exec rpc.statd --no-notify

The rpcbind process *MUST* be accepting connections before we try to mount.
That means Type=single is *NOT SUFFICIENT* because rpcbind doesn't do sd_notify (fixed in 0.2.3).

Instead we *MUST* either use rpcbind.socket or Type=forking.
(The latter works because systemd waits until the fork happens to consider rpcbind "ready",
and rpcbind finishes binding before it forks.)

We *MUST* also tell systemd that NFS mounts need to start & wait for rpcbind.

Does "systemctl add-wants" in newer versions of systemd do something like this?

    ln -s ../rpcbind.service /etc/systemd/system/srv-share.mount.wants/


WE DO NOT NEED RPCBIND -W (WARMSTART)
----------------------------------------

14:15 <twb> Does anybody understand what /run/rpcbind/*.xdr _do_ ?
14:16 <twb> AFAICT they're only used for rpcbind -w "warm start", which serializes rpcbind's internal state for when you restart rpcbind
14:18 <twb> Yeah they are.  So if I don't care about restarting rpcbind separately from a full reboot, it doesn't matter to me AT ALL.
14:18 <twb> During shutdown rpcbind will whinge that it couldn't create the files, but they're in a tmpfs anyways
