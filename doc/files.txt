There are several ways we can get files into the SOE,
with different bonuses and maluses:

1. bootstrap does printf >foo or >>foo, or sed -i foo.

   + concise for short files
   + can see all at a glance
   - comments more painful
   - long/complex formats painful & no markup

   + write to now-gone dir, or edit now-missing file,
     will error rather than silently continuing

2. filesystem.dir overlay that contains the files.

   + can easily diff upstream w/overlay
   + editor can syntax highlight XML &c
   - can't sed -i, only replace completely
   - spread out over sparse tree - hard to see
   - logically connected files may be distant
   - owner/group/mode is painful to guarantee

3. build a separate deb (from separate repo).

   + can have arch-specific files (binaries)
   + can express Depends clearly
   + can see at a glance where a conffile came from
   - replacing another deb's files is v. ugly
   - separate repo & deb is a LOT more work

Conclusion:

 - none of these are perfect
 - use method 1 for v. short arch-indep files
 - use method 2 for v. long  arch-indep files
 - use method 3 for arch-dep binaries
