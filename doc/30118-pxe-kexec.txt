Fast reboot times are "nice to have" for inmates,
but "*VERY* nice to have" for us developers.

There are two key problems with kexec:

1. Under systemd, kexec-load doesn't start reliably.

   Assuming mksquashfs.exclusions hasn't gutted systemd's sysvinit
   compatibility layers yet, this can be (more-or-less) fixed thusly::

       root@spoon:~# cat /srv/netboot/images/inmate/site.dir/etc/systemd/system/kexec-load.service.d/fix.conf
       [Service]
       ExecStop=
       ExecStop=/usr/sbin/pxe-kexec -nLl linux prisonpc
       Type=oneshot
       ExecStart=
       ExecStart=/bin/true

2. It's slower than it should be!
   See https://bugs.debian.org/806285
   On an H81 running jessie, with the above fix, it takes **55s** to reboot from xdm login to xdm login.
   It should be **40s**.

   This can't be fixed without patching the pxe-kexec source,
   or replacing it with a shitty python script (EASIER!).

   We could reduce it to **35s** without recoding pxe-kexec by simply
   running it every few minutes, instead of only during reboot.
   (This is about 25MB per desktop per interval, which is why we've avoided it so far.)

   kexec'ing ipxe would work, but (unlike pxe-kexec) it will have the STP bringup delay,
   because ipxe can't inherit the network setup from the already-running desktop.

   For comparison, jessie/h81 cold boot is **55s**.

   For comparison, jessie/h81 reboot w/o kexec is **55s**.

Because this is non-zero effort to get working *well*,
and Ron gives ZERO shits about it,
kexec is simply disabled until further notice.
