Doing this shortly before mksquashfs makes it *MUCH* easier to see
which files are modified at boot time:

    chroot $t find / -xdev -exec touch -hd2000-01-01 {} +

It also makes it harder for inmates to learn that e.g. libfoo.so is
older than that vulnerability that came out in 2012.


Unfortunately it also somehow invalidates fontconfig's metadata cache,
causing it to download all fonts at boot time, to display xdm & aup.

This means an extra ~80MiB is downloaded every boot,
which is a significant proportion of the overall download footprint.

Therefore I am not enabling it in production,
just documenting it here for debugging.
