I'd like to do this::

    >$t/etc/systemd/system.conf printf '%s\n' '[Manager]' SystemCallArchitectures=native

but it's not available, because Jessie's systemd is compiled without SECCOMP support::

    root@het:~# systemd --version
    systemd 215
    +PAM +AUDIT +SELINUX +IMA +SYSVINIT +LIBCRYPTSETUP +GCRYPT +ACL +XZ -SECCOMP -APPARMOR

In theory, this would be a defense-in-depth layer against inmates
smuggling in pre-compiled IA32 binaries (since for us, "native" means x86-64).

In practice it doesn't matter much, because we compile the inmate
kernel without CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION.

This is fixed in Debian as at systemd=220-7:

    http://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/s/systemd/systemd_228-2_changelog

When we have such a version (i.e. during stretch upgrade),
re-examine this feature.
