A massive 200 scenarios long campaign divided into 2 parts, each of them consisting of five substories. The chapters offer a varied character development and changing strategies throughout. Although preserving the traditional Wesnoth gameplay, there are also many powerful items to collect, as well as a level-up system for all units that goes beyond the L3 limit. Your recalls will be all the more unique and fun to use due to the many power-ups obtained throughout this campaign.

Also contains two coop multiplayer scenarios related to the campaign.

The campaign has two spin-offs, 'The Beautiful Child' and 'Affably Evil'. The campaign 'Kill the King' is also related.

 description = Follow the story of Krux, an evil nobleman's son. He is a nice guy, but he is not a good guy. He hates killing (dead men are bad servants), high taxes (poor men die easily and pay no taxes then) and injustice (as long as it has not concern himself or his allies). He works for his family, a deceitful and fraudulent noble house, fighting bandits (who are actually resistance), cruel despots (who are actually nobles who oppose him), false conspiracy stories (that contain too much truth) and prefers to have his enemies survive the combat (for slave work).

Consists of 9 classical scenarios and a free roam mode where 12 quests have to be completed. Experimentally changed the role of recalls (received through story), separating them from the usual recruits (that cannot be recalled), giving them an RPG-like progression. Uses Legend of the Invincibles as resources and will not run without having it installed (minimal version is 3.1.14, otherwise it will not run). The campaign is a prequel to Legend of the Invincibles, but the order in which they are played does not really matter.

That was originaly end of life on Wesnoth 1.11, but ported to 1.14 by request of Seivn. With help of gnombat, he told the name of it. It was originally Complete, playable, and winnable in its current state, but a few more features are planned.
 
However currently it has some minor bugs. I might fix them in future or not.. It should be playable but you could let me know if there is a major bug that makes it unplayable and I might do something about it. 
 
esci if you ever come back feel free to ask for password and it's all yours.
 
Very interesting project if you like to build (ANL, A new land, Undead Empire, New Settlers, Civ)

 description = Marauding Thieves is a singleplayer campaign that takes a totally different approach to Wesnoth gameplay. Here, stealth and evasion count for more than brute strength. Why charge at a guard when you can sneak past, assassinate him from the shadows or simply plant a bomb behind his back? Combat is for losers!

    The campaign takes place across a series of missions which are selected by the player on a world map of Wesnoth. There are four mission types with a variety of unique objectives (loot the chests, rescue the prisoners, blow the bridge!). With a variety of special stealth options and hiding abilities at your disposal, your ragtag team of thieves must take on the combined might of the royal empire. You will be outnumbered and overpowered, but you have the skillz.

This is a fork of 'Den of Thieves' by Bob_The_Mighty & jb.

To play the original multiplayer version with 2 or 3 players, please download their copy instead.
Marauding Thieves is the Single Player variation. It should be started from the 'Campaigns' button found at the main screen, and not from the Multiplayer setup screens.

 description = Before the Fall, a new group of humans entered the continent. The mercenary Aragwaithi bands came across the vast sea, and were involved in settling many disputes before the Fall. This is the story of one such band.
	Feedback is welcome and necessary. This campaign is very rough around the edges. It is also practically fractal in its vast quantities of edges, and <sarcasm>definitely not</sarcasm> an excuse for a campaign with the Aragwaith as the main faction. If you find the campaign hard, I recommend that you mostly recruit Guards (level 2/3 swordsmen) and a few leadership units (level 2/3/4 spearmen).
	V 0.9.2: removed some bugs and buglike occurences.

Complete but imperfectly balanced--all feedback welcome on the Wesnoth forums.

Author's note: I wrote most of this campaign while I was fairly young, so the story is pretty cliche, yet self-aggrandizing. Plenty of the scenarios are creative and fun, though, so I would still recommend giving it a play-through.

In The Black Cross of Aleron, you control Eärendil, the surviving teacher at the school, and the many and varied initiates. Not all of these are ordinary students; many have been experimenting with other forms of magic, while others are simply overachievers in some area of study. Unfortunately, they are not especially good at combat, at least initially. Together with a very small contingent of surviving guards, it is up to these students to save the land of Sharnough from disaster.

 description = Far to the south of Wesnoth, the lone survivor of a brutal raid struggles to survive long enough to exact revenge.

This is a short little prelude to my main campaign which I hope is coming soon. 

This campaign has RPG elements, with tweaked heroes and a custom AMLA. You do not often have any extra troops.
It is mostly character/plot-driven (the plot needs work), but I tried to make each individual scenario as interesting gameplay-wise as possible as well. This is my best attempt.

If you have anything worth mentioning (whether it be bugs or suggestions), please share on the forums.
(Pretty much complete, though it has slight balance errors still. If you spot errors, please report them. Any feedback at all will be recieved gratefully.)

Changelog:
v1.2.1
Mostly minor tweaks to dialogue.
Survivability for low-level characters has been increased just slightly by increasing their hitpoints by 5.
Scenario 7 was made considerably harder, adding level 2 recruits for the dragon and making him less suicidal (hopefully). Has not been tested on easy or hard levels. Further testing will take place as time allows.
-----
v1.2
Again, changes have been made to scenario 1. If you still experience frustration when playing this scenario, please let me know on the forums. Your feedback is the only thing bringing be back to (try to) make improvements.
-----
v1.1.1
Adjusted Scenario 1's balance: Made it easier, as it had always been one of the hardest scenarios.
Tweaked starting position in Scenario 4, and a bit of dialogue. Again, to accomodate different strategies.
-----
v1.1
Adjusted Scenario 1's balance. May still be a bit unbalanced.
Changed some dialogue in Scenario 4, to accomadate different strategies.
Added an Unclear Fog macro for Scenario 1.

   This campaign is mainly composed of modern warfare skirmishes (~20 v 20 units) with a few bigger battles (~40 v 40 units). The recruiting and game mechanics differ from regular wesnoth. Difficulty: expert because of the inhabitual features, but globally unbalanced.

I don't think the scenarios are particularly well balanced, none of them are very difficult. The first scenario is rather long, so I made up for it by making the scenario at the end really short :)

From looking at the code, it looked like the numbers for EASY and HARD all had midpoints between them that would make for a good NORMAL difficulty, so I went and created just such a difficulty. I also went and made some other changes, too: since the mainline tutorial suggests playing A Tale of Two Brothers directly after finishing the tutorial, I went and made the EASY difficulty here more tutorial-like, because as it stood, the mainline A Tale of Two Brothers never felt like as good of a followup to the tutorial as The South Guard or An Orcish Incursion did. Also, the Dark Adept Muff Toras has some new roles to play on all 3 difficulties. There are a few other new surprises to find as well, so be sure to try all 3 difficulties!

It features complete alternate branch, brings improvements to core scenarios - many of them posted on Northern Rebirth forum - and fixes numerous issues still remaining in version of a campaign shipped with the game. New branch has 12 scenarios (3 first scenarios are the same for both branches).

- Alternate paths that affect the whole campaign: an early decision on which path to take may have repercussions later.
- Ever-changing alliances and enemies: fight alongside outlaws, merfolk, loyalists, woses, orcs, elves, villagers and more; fight against nearly as many.

Lead Aegir, a lone dwarf who finds himself in charge of the refugees. Seek help from various allies, travel through the remains of the Wesnoth Kingdom and face a completely new foe. 
(Intermediate level, 10 scenarios + 1 dialogue)

Part II : The Sands of Revenge
War and deceit has thinned the numbers of Aegir's army, but it has hardenned the survivors even more! Soon the flight will end, help will come from the south and the free people of Wesnoth will have revenge !
(Intermediate level, 4 scenarios (incomplete))

Having played A Tale of Two Brothers will give the storyline more depht but is not required. Uses the 1.14 version of Wesnoth so will probably be buggy on older versions.

Note: This campaign features a completely new faction against which you will fight most of the time. Designed for those who have enough of fighting hordes of orcs or undead (you won't find any). I'm not an artist so the artwork might not be splendid. Im working to improve it. Soft difficulty should fit novicer players, while challenging is really meant for players who have played Wesnoth a lot. I'm working on Part II right now. Thanks for any feedback whether related to story, typo, art or balance !

While I respect the designers' decisions to make it hard, I also think players deserve an easier campaign of mainline quality where they get to play as orcs. This is my attempt to make it easy enough for even beginners to be able to handle. Note that my edits are primarily designed only to make the main objectives easier; optional objectives (such as killing enemy leaders in survival missions) still ought to be difficult. 

(18 scenarios.)

 description = In the chaos after Wesnoth fell, scattered refugees fought for resources and preyed upon one another.  The last of the Green Magi, Ani Essu, led an exodus of a dozen races to a fertile ground, the Northern Highlands.  Betrayed and murdered by those she saved, her work collapses as the refugees war with one another once again.  Two generations later, the heir to Ani's legacy, Princess Anea, is prophesied to complete the legacy or destroy it.  Is she a hero or a villain?  Only you can decide. 

Ani's Legacy - The main campaign, a non-linear campaign with eighteen different endings reachable by different user choices.  A playthrough can be from seven to twenty-six scenarios, and there are a total of 144 reachable scenarios.  After beating the campaign the first time, starting the campaign again will show you a map of the story arcs as hints about how to reach other endings.

Ani's Quest - The prequel campaign.  Despite their flaws, Ani and her band of anti-heroes lead Wesnoth refugees to the Northern Highlands.  This campaign is meant to be played after Ani's Legacy, to avoid spoilers at the end.  This is a mostly-linear campaign with an 18 scenario playthrough, and has a total of 22 reachable scenarios.

Xenoi - a multiplayer faction, which shows up as an enemy or ally in Ani's Legacy depending on user choices.  They are also briefly seen in Ani's Quest.

Both campaigns are complete and playable.  However, the developer plans on adding more story arcs and endings to Ani's Legacy, more units to the Xenoi faction, and other finishing touches.  Most work on this add-on will go towards the Apocalesus campaign, currently hidden by an DWT_ENABLE_DEBUG macro.

 description = Strange Legacy: The Orc invasion came without warning and with a brutality that caught the Human Alliance completely off guard and unprepared for. Before the year was over the Orcs controlled half of the Northland. The Winter finally halted their advance. Meh, what's the big deal. I never cared much for politics or policy. But when my uncle was gone, I started into the greatest adventure of my life.

This campaign is a classical rpg that offers a variety of options, you will just control one hero and bring him to fortune. You can trade, pickpocket, be a bard, bounty- or treasurehunter, or working as a craftsman selling your goods. You can also run a building and upgrade it or doing random generated missions. There are a lot of ways to make a fortune. But the world around isn't always friendly and it will react on your character level. You might encounter thieves, orcs, bandits or wild animals and therefore you will need a proper equipment to defend yourself.

Equip your charcter with: helmets, armors, shoes, shields, instruments, rings, amulets, ranged or meleeweapons or learn more than 80 powerful spells to gain an advantage. Hire one of 35 mercs to defend your load and recall them using your warhorn. Try to conquer an enemy town to gain a constant tax income. Encounter all kind of enemies each on changing maps, according to the terrain - even your ship might be attacked by naga warriors or dangerous pirates. Follow the storyline with 34 missions that will force you to explore the world of Strange legacy. A new amla system will allow you to create a character in the way you like him, allowing you to solve the game differently each time you play and the difficulty is increasing with each level up. 
For the most recent changes check the forum thread. Equip your uncles house with furniture allowing you to craft weapons, armors and cook food. If you like to have a classic RPG try out the RPG Mode. Have fun!

Suite à un souci de timing, cette campagne n'est jouable qu'à 15%, mais avec l'aide de la console du jeu vous pouvez tentez d'avancer et de terminer la partie.

(Intermediate level, 15 scenarios, 4 dialogue only, work in progress)

This campaign includes several hundred custom units most of which were taken from (or derived from) the Reign of the Lords Era add-on by The_Gnat and some of the mainline campaigns. A huge thanks goes to The_Gnat for letting me use his fantastic Era for this campaign. I highly recommend trying out the Reign of the Lords add-on for yourself.

This campaign shall see you fight with, and against, a wide variety of factions with changing objectives and use of custom items you can find in certain scenarios. With custom units providing a wide range of choices of advancements for your units, and unique AMLAs for certain heroes, you should not worry about running out of ways to strengthen your army.

This campaign includes repeated references to mainline campaign lore, so it is recommended (althought not strictly necessary) to first play Northern Rebirth and Eastern Invasion. There are also some minor references to The Legend of Wesmere, The Hammer of Thursagan, Heir to the Throne, and eventually, Delfador's Memoirs.

This is a work in progress with Chapters 1 and 2, as well as the first two scenarios of Chapter 3, completed so far. 5 Chapters are planned for in total. Released for Pre-Alpha testing.
