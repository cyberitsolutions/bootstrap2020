OpenSSH package includes *BOTH* socket-based and ahead-of-time systemd units.

If we start SSH ahead of time,

 - ssh-keygen slows down "booting" (but not the actual GUI login).
 - ssh-keygen runs early on, so its entropy is less random.

If we start SSH via socket,

 - ssh-keygen stdout/stderr is lost.
 - if the rootfs is gone, ssh might not start at all.
   (This shouldn't happen in production, but routinely happens during development.)

mattcen & I (twb) agreed to go with the latter.
