NEW NOTES (2016Q1) (#30645)
===========================

See https://bugs.debian.org/814758

1. power button didn't work on servers;
2. as a workaround, we used acpid;
3. acpid fails about 48% of the time at AMC; but
4. (1) was due to systemd silently failing due to lack of dbus.
5. If we install dbus everywhere (including servers!), we can remove acpid.

The older analysis below is *NOT CORRECT*.


OLD NOTES (2015Q3) (#30133)
===========================

systemd-logind.service.8 says:

    systemd-logind is a system service that manages user logins.
    It is responsible for:

    * Handling of power/sleep hardware keys
    * [...]

That means we don't need to install acpi-support-base (powerbtn.sh) just to
make the case's power button trigger a clean shutdown.
Fantastic!  Except...

                     **SYSTEMD IS FULL OF LIES**

Apparently systemd-logind ignores power button events until a "seat" appears::

    systemd-logind[404]: New seat seat0.
    systemd-logind[404]: Watching system buttons on /dev/input/event1 (Power Button)

This means that:

* the power button does not work on headless servers.
* the power button does nothing on GUI desktops *UNTIL YOU LOG IN*.
* the power button does not work on CLI desktops, *EVEN AFTER LOGGING IN*,
  because logind doesn't consider a /dev/tty1 to be a "seat".

So we MUST continue to install acpi-support-base on servers,
and we SHOULD continue to install acpi-support-base on desktops.


PS: in Wheezy we also used acpid to handle the case mute button.
In Jessie (after ir-keytable) this is handled by assuming case volume
keys will generate XF86MediaXXX key-press events for XFWM4 to catch.
