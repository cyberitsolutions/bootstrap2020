I cannot lock down unscd like this::

    sed -i /server-user/d /etc/nscd.conf      # tell unscd not to drop privs, because systemd will

    [Service] ExecStart='nscd -d' RuntimeDirectory=nscd User=unscd

...because unscd binds to *TWO* sockets:

    /run/nscd/socket
    /run/.nscd_socket

The latter hasn't been used by glibc for OVER A DECADE::

    $ git clone --bare git://repo.or.cz/glibc.git
    $ cd glibc.git
    $ git log -p HEAD -Gnscd_socket -- nscd

    Author: Ulrich Drepper <drepper@redhat.com>
    Date:   12 years ago

        Update.

            * inet/rcmd.c: Provide better error message in case of unknown
            host.  Remove USE_IN_LIBIO.

            * nscd/nscd.init: Updated version, more conforming with current
            init file standards.

            * nscd/nscd-client.h (_PATH_NSCDPID): Move the file into
            /var/run/nscd directory.
            (_PATH_NSCDSOCKET): Likewise.

            * test-skeleton.c (timeout_handler): Fix error message.

Is it worth removing support for .nscd_socket ?

#systemd said:

    "If you're using glibc, why don't you just use the REGULAR glibc nscd?"

I said

     "Because every time I've used it, it has caused heisenbugs and solved no problems.
     Also #openldap STRONGLY recommends against it because they said it caches the wrong things.
     After I switched to unscd, I never saw a problem again, and it reduces traffic to slapd by at least an order of magnitude."
