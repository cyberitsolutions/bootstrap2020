mattcen (et al),

I want a second opinion about this implementation decision.

Exclude files in dpkg.cfg (instead of mksquashfs)?

  BONUS: adding exceptions for C & en languages is MUCH clearer.

  BONUS: files aren't even extracted - build time slightly faster

  BONUS: the install & exclude lines are in the same block of code,
         rather than excludes being buried at the end of the script.

  MALUS: *ONLY* affects dpkg.  Files created with ucf or debconf will ignore the rule.

  MALUS: breaks some postinsts (e.g. dictionaries-common assumes its emacs files were created)

  MALUS: this doesn't work:

           path-exclude=/usr/share/doc
           path-include=/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/{C,en*}

         instead you have to say

           path-exclude=/usr/share/doc/*
           path-include=/usr/share/doc/kde
           path-include=/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML
           path-include=/usr/share/doc/kde/HTML/{C,en*}

         and I'm not not 100% sure that's working as desired,
         because Dad was giving a lecture while I was testing this.

The last two are the real show-stoppers.


The other alternative is one you can see in some places below,
where I explicitly do

    rm /usr/share/applications/foo.desktop

So that an upgrade changing foo.desktop to foo2.desktop causes an error and WE NOTICE.
I think I overestimated that risk and applied that idiom for unimportant things.
