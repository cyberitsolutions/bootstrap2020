Locking Down Thunderbird (and Firefox)
======================================

• https://KB.cyber.com.au/PrisonPC+MUA+FR



Is Thunderbird dead?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

From 1 Dec 2015 onwards, Mozilla has dropped Thunderbird.
They hate it because it's ‘holding back’ firefox development.
It hasn't had active development since 2012.

    https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/30/thunderbird-flies-away-from-mozilla/

As at Jan 2017,

| In Debian 8 Jessie, icedove=46.6 and firefox-esr=45.6.
| In Debian 9 Stretch, icedove=45.6 and firefox-esr=45.6.
| In Debian Unstable, thunderbird=45.6 and firefox=50.1.
| In https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/, stable=45.7 and beta/alpha=51.0.
| In https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?scene=2, stable=51.0.

What's the alternative?  Evolution?  Squirrel?

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_(software)#cite_ref-evo-newdev_21-0

While we're at it, let's just quickly check the instlal footprints
(Jessie prisonpc-desktop base SOE, sans prayer & chromium):

|    010MiB  ←  prayer prayer-templates-prisonpc=0.1wheezy1 aspell-en
|    103MiB  ←  icedove
|
|    166MiB  ←  chromium
|    100MiB  ←  firefox-esr
|
|    176MiB  ←  chromium prayer prayer-templates-prisonpc=0.1wheezy1 aspell-en
|    204MiB  ←  firefox-esr icedove

…a major loss for mail, a medium gain for web.
Because thunderbird embeds firefox instead of using firefox-esr,
we pay the full 100MB cost for firefox twice when installing both.
Net size loss.



DONE — How do I view, change & lock about:config settings?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thunderbird is mostly Firefox.
Literally — the source code is roughly
1.3GiB of firefox,
20MiB email client, and
20MiB newsreader.

.. NOTE:: because Thunderbird source is so huge,
          I've downloaded it to cyber@hasty:/srv/src/.

In both, most configuration is done via a key/value store called ‘about:config’,
similar to gconf or the Windows Registry.

To reach about:config in Thunderbird 45::

    ≡ ▸ Preferences ▸ Advanced ▸ Config Editor

The values are set in javascript files with calls like::

    lockPref("mail.server.default.offline_download", false);

There is *NO WAY* to get a complete list of about:config variables.

Even the developers and the source code do not know — some parts of
the source will create and read about:config variables that aren't
documented *anywhere*.

The about:config screen won't let you simply copy everything into a spreadsheet.
To do so, you need to do this insane hack (from #firefox on Freenode):

    :b0at: You could probably write an expression to use the prefs
      component to output everything in text to the browser
      console (not to be confused with the web console)

    :twb: "browser console" as in /dev/stderr?

    :b0at: No.

    :b0at: Part of this:
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Toolbox
      Though you don't have to enable the full browser toolbox to use it.
      It's in the tools or web dev menu.

      I don't know what thunderbird has on this.
      It might be too far behind.

      But if custom buttons or something similar works in tb,
      then you can inject a little js in to the xul context and
      do something similar.

      If you end up dumping prefs through script, this should help:
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Preferences_API
      and the nsIPrefBranch docs.

Also, some variables are hidden from the about:config UI even when supported:

    To see the dump output you have to enable
    browser.dom.window.dump.enabled […] this preference is not listed
    in about:config by default, you may need to create it.

Having said that, *many* variables are documented in the source code::

    # Most (not all!) Firefox settings.
    mozilla/modules/libpref/init/all.js
    # Most (not all!) Thunderbird-specific settings.
    mail/app/profile/all-thunderbird.js
    # Useful settings for testing / lockdown of "normal" bits.
    mozilla/testing/mozbase/mozprofile/mozprofile/profile.py

.. Admonition:: FIXME

   Go through *all* of the three files above,
   in case there are scary things to lock down that we didn't know about! —twb, Feb 2017

Things accessible via GUI config screens can be copied out of $HOME::

    root@slice:~# grep cache ~p/.icedove/*/prefs.js
    user_pref("browser.cache.disk.filesystem_reported", 1);
    user_pref("mail.server.server1.cacheCapa.acl", false);
    user_pref("mail.server.server1.cacheCapa.quota", false);
    user_pref("toolkit.telemetry.cachedClientID", "d949975c-83be-4453-ad88-008d8f892165");

.. NOTE:: The first line of prefs.js files is ignored.
          You're expected to put some non-javascript crap there,
          so you can't accidentally load it as a regular js file.

.. NOTE:: sometimes icedove exits with no GUI output whatsoever,
   no exit status, and *NOTHING* on stderr/stdout.

   To debug this, ::

       root@bet:~# NSPR_LOG_FILE=/tmp/ARGH AUTOCONFIG_DEBUG=1 NSPR_LOG_MODULES=MCD:5 icedove

       root@bet:~# echo $?
       0

       root@bet:~# cat /tmp/ARGH
       -263362752[7f60ef0575c0]: general.config.filename = prisonpc.js
       -263362752[7f60ef0575c0]: evaluating .cfg file prisonpc.js with obscureValue 0
       -263362752[7f60ef0575c0]: error evaluating .cfg file prisonpc.js 80004005

DONE — How do I pre-configure the IMAP/SMTP accounts?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
When thunderbird first starts up, after thinking for a while,
it offers to create an account.

This shouldn't happen — we know exactly what account the inmate should be using,
and we should create it in advance.

There is functionality called ‘Autoconfiguration’ which claims to help
with this — Debian includes a riseup.net.xml for that mail provider.

• https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration
• https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration/FileFormat/HowTo
• https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird/Autoconfiguration/FileFormat/Definition
• https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration:ConfigFileFormat

But this is *NOT WHAT WE WANT*, because it still requires the user to
manually say “my username is fred and my mail provider is prisonpc” —
more control than we want inmates to have.

Instead we want to get the username from Linux and automatically
include that in the configuration variables, like

    lockPref('foo.bar', '%{USERNAME}@%{MAILNAME}')

These documents from 2012 explain how to do so using getenv():

• https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/Enterprise
• http://web.mit.edu/~firefox/www/maintainers/autoconfig.html
• https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MCD,_Mission_Control_Desktop_AKA_AutoConfig

Unfortunately when I tried doing that directly in /etc/icedove/pref/prisonpc.js,
my rules were silently ignored.
To make getenv work, I *had to* do this::

    In /etc/icedove/pref/foo.js:

        # first line is ignored
        lockPref('general.config.filename', 'bar.js');

    In /usr/lib/icedove/bar.js:

        # first line is ignored
        lockPref('foo.bar', getenv('USER') + '@' + getenv('MAILNAME'));

This comment from RTFS makes it sound like this special ‘netscape.cfg’
js format is off by default because it's old and horrible:

   The following is a small hack which will allow us to only load the library
   which supports the netscape.cfg file if the preference is defined. We
   test for the existence of the pref, set in the all.js (mozilla) or
   all-ns.js (netscape 6), and if it exists we startup the pref config
   category which will do the rest.

   — icedove-45.6.0/mozilla/modules/libpref/Preferences.cpp:Preferences::Init()


How accounts work in about:config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In about:config, there are accounts, ids, and servers.
There are master variables like::

    mail.accountmanager.accounts=account1,account2,account2

And then each account/server/id is built as a *set* of variables, like::

    mail.accounts.account1.foo=true
    mail.accounts.account1.bar=2
    mail.accounts.account1.quux="Frobozz"

There are default values that are used when creating a new account,
or when the account doesn't override it with a local variable::

    mail.server.default.offline_download=false
    mail.server.server1.offline_download=true

Finally, note that OUTGOING mail ("mail.smtpserver.smtpN") is configured
separately from a mailbox server ("mail.server.serverN").

.. Admonition:: FIXME

   Does it have to be called "accountN", or
   can we call it something like "account_PrisonPC" ? —twb, Feb 2017



DONE — Thunderbird doesn't trust PrisonPC CA cert
----------------------------------------------------------------------
My mail server uses an in-house CA.
It's trusted by default in /etc/ssl/ (OpenSSL, GnuTLS), but tbird apparently doesn't know about that.
How do I convince thunderbird to trust my CA (and preferably *ONLY* my CA)?

    :twb: Where does Icedove (and Firefox ESR) store their CA cert
          trust list?  As a sysadmin I want to force ALL local users
          to trust my corporate CA cert, and (ideally) untrust all the
          default ones.

          I already solved this for chromium by overwriting ~/.pki
          every time the user logs in (because chromium uses nss3 in a
          configuration that ignores /etc/ entirely), but apparently
          that's not enough for icedove

          I remember seeing some horror stories about how firefox
          default CA list was compiled into an .so (!) and couldn't be
          modified by sysadmins at all, but I haven't found that bug
          report yet.

          Simply stracing icedove hasn't helped either :/

    :jm: possibly cert8.db, but db_dump does not work for me on that file.

    :twb: I hope I don't have to copy it to *yet another* dir in $HOME.

          Stupid libnss3 only supports having one directory to search
          in, so it can't search in both /etc/pki and ~/.pki at once…

    :jm: Maybe this can help with part of the problem
         https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:AddRootToFirefox

         Some interesting stuff here too
         http://askubuntu.com/questions/244582/add-certificate-authorities-system-wide-on-firefox

         Firefox's source code shows that built-in CA certs are in
         fact hard-coded into firefox executable. They reside in
         security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt

    :twb: At least with chromium it's ~/.pki and not ~/.icedove/<random string>.default/ ☹

          I guess the script will have to iterate over every dir in ~/.icedove/ or something AND again in the /etc/…/profile skeleton.

          This is all nss3's fault of course.
          (That, plus on Windows and OS X all GUI browsers uses the system cert keyring, so this problem only affects GNU and BSD users, and they're second-class citizens…)

          Ah yeah I see in strace it accessing certX.db directly in the root of [ProfD].
          I was searching before only for /tls|ssl|ca|pki/i so didn't find it.

    :jm: Can it be inspected with certutil?

    :twb: yeah, I just don't have certutil normally installed on inmate hosts because URGH.

          I used to actually run certutil when they logged in, only
          importing my key instead of just blowing away their entire
          certificate hierarchy.  But it too so long, they'd start up
          the browser, and they'd have a fight to edit it (no locking,
          apparently), and leave their $HOME permanently broken

          I tried a simple ``cp -vat ~/.icedove/*.*/ ~/.pki/nssdb/*``
          (while icedove was off); starting icedove shows same
          "confirm exception" popup

          Hrm wait, there's that "AutoConfig via JavaScript" thing in
          your first link.  I already have to use that to lock
          preferences (because the more modern ways flat out don't
          work for sysadmins), so I could try adding it in there

          Of course, that API probably won't let me copy the CA cert
          from ~/.pki/nssdb/cert9.db, so I'll have to have a second
          copy stored directly in autoconfig.js… ☹

DONE — Local Folders must die!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

‘Local Folders’ appears in the sidebar by default.
We don't want them — all mail SHOULD live in IMAP, not $HOME!

Unfortunately there is no simple way to remove or hide it, *allegedly*.

Update: gumph link below suggests initialize prefs.js,
then go through and change server2/id2/account2 to server1/id1/account1.

• At first I tried just deleting all the server2 &c lines,
  and removing server2 &c from mail.accountmanager.accounts.

  That just made the account wizard start appearing again (on Icedove start).

• The second time I went through and kept all the variables and changed them,
  including changing references like "mail.root.none" to IMAP versions.

  At that point, the wizard stopped appearing, and folders like Sent
  appeared under the IMAP account instead of under Local Folders, but
  Local Folders itself was still appearing (being auto-created).

• I went through the about:config screen again looking for "locally
  configured" (as opposed to locked) account settings, and I found an
  extra variable that hadn't been referenced before. ::

    mail.accountmanager.localfoldersserver=server2

  Setting that worked, and Local Folders are finally gone for good!

TODO — Hide unwanted UI elements
----------------------------------------------------------------------

From #firefox (irc.mozilla.org):

    :twb: Is there something like userChrome.css, but for the distro vendor / site sysadmin?
          I can just put stuff in the default profile, but users might delete it
          (ATM I'm leaning towards "I'll just live with that risk.")

          Awesome. Putting ``*{display:none}`` in
          ``~prisoner1234/.icedove/*/chrome/userChrome.css`` does what
          you'd expect — completely empty window.

          Now I "just" need to use increasingly smaller hammers to
          hide the UI widgets I dislike.

    :Cork: Or you could just use the dom inspector and find the element you want to hide.

    :twb: How do I do that for tbird?

    apt install xul-ext-dom-inspector???

    THE NEXT DAY…

    :twb: I'm trying to learn how to use the "dom inspector" so that I
          can write userChrome.css to hide undesirable UI elements
          from my end users.

          When I do Ctrl+Shift+i in tbird, I get the UI shown in these
          screenshots:
          https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM_Inspector/Introduction_to_DOM_Inspector

          …when I do Ctrl+Shift+i in firefox, I get a different UI and
          I can't see any way to select chrome URLs for inspection.

    :arai: [File] menu ▸ [Inspect Chrome Document]
           (also, Browser Toolbox provides similar Inspector

    :twb: oh, I see, there are *TWO* Ctrl+Shift+i bindings — "show tools" and "inspector".
          If I pick the latter from Tools menu, I get the same pane I see in tbird.
          (Er, bad quoting; lemme move these two computers closer together so I can transcribe easier…)

          The process is… right-click in empty part of tabbar, click
          "Menu Bar" to unhide menu bar, click Tools ▸ Web Developer ▸ DOM Inspector

          What I don't understand is in the DOM Inspector, in both FF
          and Tbird, for a chrome URL
          (e.g. chrome://browser/content/browser.xul), the "DOM Nodes"
          view is completely blank.

          Shouldn't there be menus and stuff in there?

    :arai: I see grid and tree there.
           Which element do you select?

    :twb: just a sec
          http://www.cyber.com.au/~twb/tmp/tmp.png
          That's after clicking File ▸ Inspect Chrome Document ▸ Mozilla Firefox
    :arai: Maybe e10s is enabled?  Multiple processes or something.
    :twb: What's e10s?
    :arai: "Multiprocess Windows"
    :twb: I don't use GUI browsers at all so this is a completely stock Debian 8 Jessie firefox-esr
    :arai: what does the "Multiprocess Windows" say in about:support ?
    :twb: 0/2 (default: false)
    :arai: Hm,  then it's not enabled.
    :twb: Could this be because it needs a kernel feature I've disabled?
          e.g. in /proc is only shown user's own processes

    :arai: no idea how kernel feature is related
    :arai: I guess it should work then tho, it might be nice to try Browser Toolbox.
           That's builtin one.
           https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Toolbox

    :twb: I'm only using DOM inspector because that's what [somebody here told me to use yesterday].
    :twb: arai: can I use this "browser toolbox" thing for tbird as well?
    :arai: I don't know.  You could ask in #maildev or #devtools.
    :twb: Righto.  Plan B is to just git grep across comm-central :P
    :arai: Hehe.
           Maybe, you could use remote debugging instead for Thunderbird:
           https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Remote_Debugging
           https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Remote_Debugging/Thunderbird

    :twb: Is #maildev better than #thunderbird to ask about such things?
    :arai: I don't know about #thunderbird, but #maildev is for developers.
    :twb: OK.  I'm a sysadmin so I'm often halfway between using an app and developing it ☺
    :arai: IIUC, remote debugging is basically the thing used by browser toolbox.
    :arai: For thunderbird, you can use Firefox's debugger for thunderbird process.
    :twb: I see.
          …
          OK I managed to connect the remote debugger thing to thunderbird.
          Not sure how I kinda click on a UI element and say "tell me a CSS selector that'll match this".

    :arai: do you see toolbox window?
           This one (maybe in different color): https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11121/browser-toolbox.png

    :twb: Oh I see waaaay under all the "xul-overlay" lines there is a <window>.
          If I hover over that, I start to see dashed red lines around UI elements in the tbird window.
    :arai: The button with "rectangle and arrow" next to "Inspector", at top-left corner will work
           Click it and click the element you want to inspect.
    :twb: arai: ah yeah I see the button you mean now.
    :twb: It's a bit confusing what it's jumping to here http://www.cyber.com.au/~twb/tmp/tmp.png
    :twb: But directly below the Inpector/Console/Debugger/… line, there is a search bar.
          If I type in a random guess like #CreateAccount then it flashes a red dashed line around the UI element,
          showing me what was selected, even though it's not showing me the XML that defined it.
          I think that's probably enough for me to get started.

          Aha!  If I do the rectangle-and-arrow icon and hover over
          elements on the host itself, then the inspection window
          *DOES* jump to the relevant XML now.

          I guess it wasn't working before because I was doing it over VNC.

          Yay learning!

    THE NEXT DAY…

    :twb: /JOIN #firefox
    :twb: Hey so I am using firefox to inspect thunderbird, and I can inspect UI elements (chrome) on the main tbird window.
          But when I try to do so for e.g. the Preferences dialog window, it seems to ignore me.
          What am I doing wrong?  Do I need to set up a second "remote debugging" connection for the preferences window?

    :Caspy7: twb: you may keep #devtools channel in mind too
    :Cork: twb: the preference is a content now days, not a window.  That is prob why it fails for you.
    :twb: Is the difference between content and chrome kinda artificial then?
          It seems weird to treat the preferences dialog like another website.

          I tried connecting again to thunderbird but the "Connect to
          remote device" screen is only showing
          "available remote processes: Main Process",
          even though the preferences dialog is open.

    :twb: /JOIN #devtools
    :twb: I'm a sysadmin trying to lock down thunderbird for prison
          kiosks.  Some nice people on #firefox helped me set up
          https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Remote_Debugging/Thunderbird
          and that is working for the main thunderbird window

          But when I try to inspect chrome elements of dialog windows
          Preferences or Account Settings, the inspector seems to
          ignore it completely.

.. NOTE:: Here's the important part of the above discussion.

   • apt install firefox-esr icedove xul-ext-dom-inspector  # on Debian 8 Jessie
   • Open Firefox and Thunderbird.
   • In Thunderbird, click Tools > Allow Remote Debugging

   • In Firefox,

     • right-click on empty tabbar area, enable menu bar.
     • click Tools > Web Developer > Toggle Tools.
     • in the bottombar that appears,

       • click the gear icon (Toolbox Options).
       • scroll all the way to the bottom
       • check "Enable remote debugging"

     • click Tools > Web Developer > Connect
     • click Connect

   • A "confirm connection" popup will appear (from tbird).  Allow it.
   • In the Inspector (Firefox) window that appears,

     • Click the pointer-in-rectangle icon in the top-left.

     • Hover over a thunderbird UI element.
       Red dashed border will appear.
       In inspector window, it will jump to the relevant XML element (e.g. <row id="CreateAccounts …>).

     • Write a CSS selector rule accordingly. (e.g. "#CreateAccounts{display:none}").

     • You can test it in real time by adding CSS rules in the RHS pane of the Inspector window.





TODO — CRITICAL ISSUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
• TODO: in both spell checking languages, EVERY WORD is considered misspelt (test string: "I am going to eat your soul.").

• TODO: Offline Mode is not properly disabled

  Even though I explicitly disabled offline caching,
  I found that there was 90MB of shit in ~/.cache/icedove for test user p (who had lots of emails).
  Choosing "clear cache" in the GUI preferences dialogue didn't help *AT ALL*.

• TODO: testing with a 1600 message / 200MB mailbox,
  I found that as I read large messages,
  ~/.icedove was not growing much, but
  ~/.cache/icedove was getting really big (80MB).

  NOTE: firefox has the same issue.

  NOTE: the cache is *not* deleted when icedove exits.

  Can we tell icedove to cache in /run/$EUID/icedove instead?
  Is that another ``XDG_*`` environment variable we can/should set?

  One or more of these options fixes this issue.

  **FIXME**: find out which one(s)!

  I believe (based on the names alone),
  that this causes Icedove to cache *message bodies* in RAM but not in $HOME.

  I *think* that header indexes are still cached in ~/.icedove (.msf files?)

TODO — IMPORTANT issues
-----------------------
• DONE: folders created in prayer (e.g. "Kids" or "Parole 2016") are
  not visible in the sidebar by default.  I can manually add them all
  one-at-a-time by right-clicking on PrisonPC and clicking "Subscribe…",
  but this will cause transition grief.

  ⇒ mail.server.default.using_subscription=false

• TODO: if you toggle between View ▸ Layout ▸  Classic and ▸ Unified,
  a sequence of extra accounts pile up as account99 onwards
  (due to locking mail.account.lastKey=98).

  Either lock "unified" view on (or off), or hide it as a
  configuration option in the menu.

• TODO: Remove the "Security" button and menu item from the compose window.
  (This offers signing and encryption.)

• TODO: can S/MIME support be completely stripped out?


TODO — Nice-to-have issues
----------------------------------------------------------------------
• TODO: lock mail.server.{default,server1}.leave_on_server=true ?!
• TODO: change default layout to "Wide view" (but don't lock it).

  because we're going to downsample it to that anyway.

  ⇒ mailnews.display.prefer_plaintext=true ?

• TODO: change default folder layout to "unified" (but don't lock it)?
  This gets rid of the "PrisonPC" top-level folder.
  …until you create any non-standard folders, until which it comes back, ugh.

• TODO: hide "view headers all" option.

• TODO: move "sent-mail" to "Sent" ?

  The "sent-mail" folder doesn't have a pretty icon,
  despite being configured as the outbox.

  UPDATE: the icon is working now, so the only downside is the
  unintuitive name. —twb, 24 Feb 2017 ::

• TODO: reportbug icedove -s "Debian tries to be UTF-8 everywhere, but
  icedove defaults to mailnews.new_default_charset=ISO-8859-1"

• TODO: we can stop inmates from creating HTML mails,
  but incoming mail is unavoidably HTML — *or is it*?

  Is there an DNS RR we could set on e.g. amc.prisonpc.com,
  that hints to gmail / yahoo / hotmail that the domain ONLY handles text/plain,
  so gmail / yahoo / hotmail users should *automatically* be put into
  text/plain editing mode when *COMPOSING* the email?


TODO — everything else I forgot to mention
------------------------------------------
• TODO: remove "create new account"

  • UPDATE: can/should we do this with userChrome.css ?

    https://mike.kaply.com/2012/03/22/customizing-firefox-advanced-autoconfig-files/

    AFAICT what that code is ACTUALLY doing is saying ``mkdir -p $ProfD/chrome/`` and ``echo … >$ProfD/chrome/userChrome.css``.

• TODO: why can't I create a new "outgoing" account using something other than SMTP?
• TODO: migrate address book (from prayer)?
• TODO: migrate aspell local dictionary (from prayer)?
• TODO: disable "error console".
• TODO: watch space usage in ~/.icedove.
• TODO: if inmates can simply run "icedove --safe-mode",
  they can bypass anything we lock down / hide in via extensions?
  If so what can we do to block this usage?

• For staff viewing an inmate mailbox,
  "icedove --profile Foo", and
  set up prisonpc.js to detect that somehow and change the locked variables?

• TODO: should we install the iceowl (lightning/sunbird) extension?
  If so, how do we lock it down properly?

  UPDATE: I tried installing it; with iceowl & prisonpc.js both installed,
  icedove crashes immediately on startup, and running it with --safe-mode and/or rm -rf'ing ~/.icedove does not help.
  When I remove enable-prisonpc.js and prisonpc.js, with iceowl installed, icedove starts normally.

  (So, probably just a deeply fucked-up error in prisonpc.js?)

• TODO: install icedove-l10n-en-gb (and iceowl-l10n-en-gb)?  There's no en-au.

• TODO: should we set mailnews.plaintext_domains to <local domain> ?

• TODO: change mailnews.view_default_charset from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8.

• TODO sending emails times out trying to talk to smtp.lan.
  Is submission port not open on inmate interface for postfix???

• TODO: print and print preview hang the entire app for some time, possibly forever.
  is slice cups in a coherent state?
  is because thunderbird assumes it can send certain IPP commands that our server disallows due to default-deny?

• TODO: spell checking offers en_US and en_AU, but defaults to en_US.

• TODO: can't just email "s123" without including the local mail domain (e.g. @frobozz.prisonpc.com).
  Is this a regression?  Should we "fix" it?

  Should we fix it by teaching thunderbird how to get usernames out of LDAP?
  This will **NOT** let inmates auto-complete staff email address, and vice-versa.

• TODO: encryption/decryption is not explicitly blocked.

  You can click those buttons in the UI and it just says "I'd let you,
  but first you need to import a relevant certificate".

  A smart enough inmate could probably do that.

  It's also not clear to me why it is ONLY talking about certificates
  (S/MIME) and not keys (GPG).

  ::

    19:55 <twb> Does thunderbird not even support GPG at all anymore, only S/MIME ?
    19:55 <twb> Because 'sign this mail' just says "STFU MOFO U HAF NO CERTS"

  UPDATE::

    11:24 <twb> AFAICT thunderbird ships with S/MIME support built-in, but GPG support is an add-on called "enigmail".  Is that right?


• TODO: GECOS user full names is deliberately blocked, but we should
  UNBLOCK IT for the user's own name.  That would let us
  automatically set p123's From address to "Fred Nurk
  <p123@blackgate.prisonpc.com>" instead of just
  "p123@blackgate.prisonpc.com".

  This requires some fiddling in nslcd and/or slapd olcAccess rules.
  There's an open existing task to improve the latter anyway.

  This may not be possible.

• TODO: does "global search" stuff 1. work; 2. work well; 3. cause giant slowdowns; 4. fill up $HOME ?
  Need to test on a v. large mailbox with multiple folders.

• TODO: does thunderbird provide a way to edit regular text files?
  If so, can we remove / block / nerf same?
  (This is a (STRONG) SHOULD NOT.)

• TODO: change the default for forward from "inline" to
  "as attachment" because FOR FUCK'S SAKE, THE 21ST CENTURY IS MIME.

• TODO: the Preferences > Advanced > Network & Disk Space > Disk Space
  default is "use up to 350MB of space for the cache".

  This is CLEARLY FAR TOO HIGH.

• TODO: remove the "Go Offline" buttons (inc. clicking on the
  bottom-left network icon thing in main window).

• TODO: how do we lock the list of allowed extensions,
  so that even if inmates download an extension somehow,
  they can't enable it?

  (NOTE: we already do exactly this for chromium.)


• DONE: are there any extensions in Debian just waiting for us to
  install them that will make lockdown easier?

  I searched in aptitude for ``?depends(icedove)``.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This file is interesting,
it includes a set of preferences for firefox and thunderbird that are set during testing.
It turns off a lot of the "phone home to the internet and snitch on the user" settings. ::


    EXAMPLE ⇒

    // Unless overridden per-account, don't download emails into the local store.
    // NOTE: we should lock all the overrides, too.
    lockPref('mail.server.default.offline_download', false);
    // Don't spy on the user and report back to mozilla.com.
    lockPref('toolkit.telemetry.enabled', false);
