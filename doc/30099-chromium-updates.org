* Startup — Startup, Home page and New Tab page
 Configure the pages to load on startup, the default home page and the default new tab page in Google Chrome and prevents users from changing them.

       The user's home page settings are only completely locked down if you either select the home page to be the new tab page, or set it to be a URL and specify a home page URL. If you don't specify the home page URL, then the user is still able to set the home page to the new tab page by specifying 'chrome://newtab'.

       The policy 'URLs to open on startup' is ignored unless you select 'Open a list of URLs' in 'Action on startup'.

** ShowHomeButton — Show Home button on toolbar
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled shows the Home button on Google Chrome's toolbar. Setting the policy to Disabled keeps the Home button from appearing.

       If you set the policy, users can't change it in Google Chrome. If not set, users chooses whether to show the Home button.

** HomepageLocation — Configure the home page URL
SYNOPSIS: "https://www.chromium.org"
 Setting the policy sets the default homepage URL in Google Chrome. You open the homepage using the Home button. On desktop, the RestoreOnStartup policies control the pages that open on startup.

       If the homepage is set to the New Tab Page, by the user or HomepageIsNewTabPage, this policy has no effect.

        The URL needs a standard scheme, such as http://example.com or https://example.com. When this policy is set, users can't change their homepage URL in Google Chrome.

       Leaving both HomepageLocation and HomepageIsNewTabPage unset lets users choose their homepage.

       On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

** HomepageIsNewTabPage — Use New Tab Page as homepage
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled makes the New Tab page the user's homepage, ignoring any homepage URL location. Setting the policy to Disabled means that their homepage is never the New Tab page, unless the user's homepage URL is set to chrome://newtab.

       If you set the policy, users can't change their homepage type in Google Chrome. If not set, the user decides whether or not the New Tab page is their homepage.

       On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

** NewTabPageLocation — Configure the New Tab page URL
SYNOPSIS: "https://www.chromium.org"
 Setting the policy configures the default New Tab page URL and prevents users from changing it.

       The New Tab page opens with new tabs and windows.

       This policy doesn't decide which pages open on start up. Those are controlled by the RestoreOnStartup policies. This policy does affect the homepage, if that's set to open the New Tab page, as well as the startup page if it's set to open the New Tab page.

       It is a best practice to provide fully canonicalized URL, if the URL is not fully canonicalized Google Chrome will default to https://.

       Leaving the policy unset or empty puts the default New Tab page in use.

       On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

** RestoreOnStartup — Action on startup
SYNOPSIS: 4
 Setting the policy lets you specify system behavior on startup. Turning this setting off amounts to leaving it unset as Google Chrome must have specified start up behavior.

       If you set the policy, users can't change it in Google Chrome. If not set, users can change it.

       Setting this policy to RestoreOnStartupIsLastSession turns off some settings that rely on sessions or that perform actions on exit, such as clearing browsing data on exit or session-only cookies.

       On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

** RestoreOnStartupURLs — URLs to open on startup
SYNOPSIS: ["https://example.com", "https://www.chromium.org"]
 If RestoreOnStartup is set to RestoreOnStartupIsURLs, then setting RestoreOnStartupURLs to a list of URLs specify which URLs open.

       If not set, the New Tab page opens on start up.

       On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

       Chrome Remote Desktop host is a native service that runs on the target machine that a user can connect to using Chrome Remote Desktop application.  The native service is packaged and executed separately from the Google Chrome browser.

       These policies are ignored unless the
       Chrome Remote Desktop host is installed.

** RemoteAccessClientFirewallTraversal (DEPRECATED) — Enable firewall traversal from remote access client
SYNOPSIS: false
 This policy is no longer supported.
           Enables usage of STUN and relay servers when connecting to a remote client.

           If this setting is enabled, then this machine can discover and connect to remote host machines even if they are separated by a firewall.

           If this setting is disabled and outgoing UDP connections are filtered by the firewall, then this machine can only connect to host machines within the local network.

** RemoteAccessHostClientDomainList — Configure the required domain names for remote access clients
SYNOPSIS: ["my-awesome-domain.com", "my-auxiliary-domain.com"]
 Setting the policy specifies the client domain names that are imposed on remote access clients, and users can't change them. Only clients from one of the specified domains can connect to the host.

       Setting the policy to an empty list or leaving it unset applies the default policy for the connection type. For remote assistance, this allows clients from any domain to connect to the host. For anytime remote access, only the host owner can connect.

** RemoteAccessHostTalkGadgetPrefix (DEPRECATED) — Configure the TalkGadget prefix for remote access hosts
SYNOPSIS: "chromoting-host"
 Configures the TalkGadget prefix that will be used by remote access hosts and prevents users from changing it.

           If specified, this prefix is prepended to the base TalkGadget name to create a full domain name for the TalkGadget. The base TalkGadget domain name is '.talkgadget.google.com'.

           If this setting is enabled, then hosts will use the custom domain name when accessing the TalkGadget instead of the default domain name.

           If this setting is disabled or not set, then the default TalkGadget domain name ('chromoting-host.talkgadget.google.com') will be used for all hosts.

           Remote access clients are not affected by this policy setting. They will always use 'chromoting-client.talkgadget.google.com' to access the TalkGadget.

** RemoteAccessHostMatchUsername — Require that the name of the local user and the remote access host owner match
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled has the remote access host compare the name of the local user the host is associated with and the name of the Google Account registered as the host owner ("johndoe," if the host is owned by "johndoe@example.com"). This host won't start if the host owner's name differs from the name of the local user that the host is associated with. To enforce that the owner's Google Account is associated with a specific domain, use the policy with RemoteAccessHostDomain.

* PasswordManager — Password manager
 Configures the password manager.

** PasswordManagerEnabled — Enable saving passwords to the password manager
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled means users have Google Chrome remember passwords and provide them the next time they sign in to a site.

       Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't save new passwords, but previously saved passwords will still work.

       If the policy is set, users can't change it in Google Chrome. If not set, the user can turn off password saving.

** PasswordManagerAllowShowPasswords (DEPRECATED) — Allow users to show passwords in Password Manager (deprecated)
SYNOPSIS: false
 The associated setting was used before reauthentication on viewing passwords was introduced. Since then, the setting and hence this policy had no effect on the behavior of Chrome. The current behavior of Chrome is now the same as if the policy was set to disable showing passwords in clear text in the password manager settings page. That means that the settings page contains just a placeholder, and only upon the user clicking "Show" (and reauthenticating, if applicable) Chrome shows the password. Original description of the policy follows below.

           Controls whether the user may show passwords in clear text in the password manager.

           If you disable this setting, the password manager does not allow showing stored passwords in clear text in the password manager window.

           If you enable or do not set this policy, users can view their passwords in clear text in the password manager.

* Proxy — Proxy server
 Allows you to specify the proxy server used by Google Chrome and prevents users from changing proxy settings.

       If you choose to never use a proxy server and always connect directly, all other options are ignored.

       If you choose to auto detect the proxy server, all other options are ignored.

       For detailed examples, visit:
       https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings#TOC-Command-line-options-for-proxy-sett.

       If you enable this setting, Google Chrome and ARC-apps ignore all proxy-related options specified from the command line.

       Leaving these policies not set will allow the users to choose the proxy settings on their own.

** ProxyMode (DEPRECATED) — Choose how to specify proxy server settings
SYNOPSIS: "direct"
 This policy is deprecated, please use ProxySettings instead.

        Setting the policy to Enabled lets you specify the proxy server Chrome uses and prevents users from changing proxy settings. Chrome and ARC-apps ignore all proxy-related options specified from the command line. The policy only takes effect if the ProxySettings policy isn't specified.

        Other options are ignored if you choose:
          * direct = Never use a proxy server and always connect directly
          * system = Use system proxy settings
          * auto_detect = Auto detect the proxy server

        If you choose to use:
          * fixed_servers = Fixed proxy servers. You can specify further options with ProxyServer and ProxyBypassList. Only the HTTP proxy server with the highest priority is available for ARC-apps.
          * pac_script =  A .pac proxy script. Use ProxyPacUrl to set the URL to a proxy .pac file.

       Leaving the policy unset lets users choose the proxy settings.

       Note: For detailed examples, visit The Chromium Projects ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings#TOC-Command-line-options-for-proxy-sett ).

** ProxyServerMode (DEPRECATED) — Choose how to specify proxy server settings
SYNOPSIS: 2
 This policy is deprecated, use ProxyMode instead.

           Allows you to specify the proxy server used by Google Chrome and prevents users from changing proxy settings.

           This policy only takes effect  if the ProxySettings policy has not been specified.

           If you choose to never use a proxy server and always connect directly, all other options are ignored.

           If you choose to use system proxy settings or auto detect the proxy server, all other options are ignored.

           If you choose manual proxy settings, you can specify further options in 'Address or URL of proxy server', 'URL to a proxy .pac file' and 'Comma-separated list of proxy bypass rules'. Only the HTTP proxy server with the highest priority is available for ARC-apps.

           For detailed examples, visit:
           https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings#TOC-Command-line-options-for-proxy-sett.

           If you enable this setting, Google Chrome ignores all proxy-related options specified from the command line.

           Leaving this policy not set will allow the users to choose the proxy settings on their own.

SYNOPSIS: "123.123.123.123:8080"
 This policy is deprecated, please use ProxySettings instead.

        Setting the policy lets you specify the URL of the proxy server. This policy only takes effect if the ProxySettings policy isn't specified and you selected fixed_servers with ProxyMode.

 This policy is deprecated, please use ProxySettings instead.

        Setting the policy means Google Chrome bypasses any proxy for the list of hosts given here. This policy only takes effect if the ProxySettings policy isn't specified and you specified either fixed_servers or pac_script for ProxyMode.

SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled skips CNAME lookup. The server name is used as entered when generating the Kerberos SPN.

       Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means CNAME lookup determines the canonical name of the server when generating the Kerberos SPN.

 Setting the policy to Enabled and entering a nonstandard port (in other words, a port other than 80 or 443) includes it in the generated Kerberos SPN.

       Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means the generated Kerberos SPN won't include a port.

       Setting the policy to Disabled forbids non-secure HTTP requests from using the Basic authentication scheme; only secure HTTPS is allowed.

       This policy setting is ignored (and Basic is always forbidden) if the AuthSchemes policy is set and does not include Basic.

SYNOPSIS: "*.example.com,example.com"
 Setting the policy specifies which servers should be allowed for integrated authentication. Integrated authentication is only on when Google Chrome gets an authentication challenge from a proxy or from a server in this permitted list.

       Leaving the policy unset means Google Chrome tries to detect if a server is on the intranet. Only then will it respond to IWA requests. If a server is detected as internet, then Google Chrome ignores IWA requests from it.

       Note: Separate multiple server names with commas. Wildcards, *, are allowed.

** AuthNegotiateDelegateByKdcPolicy — Use KDC policy to delegate credentials.
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled means HTTP authentication respects approval by KDC policy. In other words, Google Chrome delegates user credentials to the service being accessed if the KDC sets OK-AS-DELEGATE on the service ticket. See RFC 5896 ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5896.html ). The service should also be allowed by AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist.

       Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means KDC policy is ignored on supported platforms and only AuthNegotiateDelegateAllowlist is respected.

       On Microsoft® Windows®, KDC policy is always respected.

       Setting the policy to Disabled turns NTLMv2 off.

       All recent versions of Samba and Microsoft® Windows® servers support NTLMv2. This should only be turned off for backward compatibility as it reduces the security of authentication.

* Extensions — Extensions
 Configures extension-related policies. The user is not allowed to install blocked extensions unless they are whitelisted. You can also force Google Chrome to automatically install extensions by specifying them in ExtensionInstallForcelist. Force-installed extensions are installed regardless whether they are present in the blocklist.

** ExtensionInstallAllowlist — Configure extension installation allow list
SYNOPSIS: ["extension_id1", "extension_id2"]
 Setting the policy specifies which extensions are not subject to the blocklist.

        A blocklist value of * means all extensions are blocked and users can only install extensions listed in the allow list.

        By default, all extensions are allowed. But, if you prohibited extensions by policy, use the list of allowed extensions to change that policy.

** ExtensionInstallBlocklist — Configure extension installation blocklist
SYNOPSIS: ["extension_id1", "extension_id2"]
 Allows you to specify which extensions the users can NOT install. Extensions already installed will be disabled if blocked, without a way for the user to enable them. Once an extension disabled due to the blocklist is removed from it, it will automatically get re-enabled.

           A blocklist value of '*' means all extensions are blocked unless they are explicitly listed in the allowlist.

           If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in Google Chrome.

** ExtensionInstallBlacklist (DEPRECATED) — Configure extension installation blacklist
SYNOPSIS: ["extension_id1", "extension_id2"]
 This policy is deprecated, please use the 'ExtensionInstallBlocklist' policy instead.

        Setting the policy specifies which extensions users can't install. Extensions already installed are turned off, if prohibited, without a way for users to turn them on. If a prohibited extension gets removed from the blocked list, it's automatically re-enabled. Use a value of * to prohibit all extensions, except those explicitly allowed.

       If the policy is unset, users can install any extension in Google Chrome.

 This policy is deprecated, please use the 'ExtensionInstallAllowlist' policy instead.

       Setting the policy specifies which extensions are exempt from the list of prohibited extensions. Use a value of * for ExtensionInstallBlacklist to prohibit all extensions, and users can only install explicitly allowed extensions. By default, all extensions are allowed. But, if you prohibited extensions by policy, use the list of allowed extensions to change that policy.

** ExtensionInstallForcelist — Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions
SYNOPSIS: ["aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx", "abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop"]
 Setting the policy specifies a list of apps and extensions that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off. Permissions are granted implicitly, including for the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. (These 2 APIs aren't available to apps and extensions that aren't force-installed.)

       Leaving the policy unset means no apps or extensions are autoinstalled, and users can uninstall any app or extension in Google Chrome.

       This policy superseeds ExtensionInstallBlocklist policy. If a previously force-installed app or extension is removed from this list, Google Chrome automatically uninstalls it.

       On Microsoft® Windows® instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be forced installed if the instance is joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management.

       On macOS instances, apps and extensions from outside the Chrome Web Store can only be force installed if the instance is managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

       The source code of any extension may be altered by users through developer tools, potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional. If this is a concern, set the DeveloperToolsDisabled policy.

       Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an "update" URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found, for example, on chrome://extensions when in Developer mode. If specified, the "update" URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate ). By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used. The "update" URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL in the extension's manifest.

        Note: This policy doesn't apply to Incognito mode. Read about hosting extensions ( https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting ).

** ExtensionInstallSources — Configure extension, app, and user script install sources
SYNOPSIS: ["https://corp.mycompany.com/*"]
 Setting the policy specifies which URLs may install extensions, apps, and themes. Before Google Chrome 21, users could click on a link to a *.crx file, and Google Chrome would offer to install the file after a few warnings. Afterwards, such files must be downloaded and dragged to the Google Chrome settings page. This setting allows specific URLs to have the old, easier installation flow.

       Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users can easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

       ExtensionInstallBlocklist takes precedence over this policy. That is, an extension on the blocklist won't be installed, even if it happens from a site on this list.

** ExtensionAllowedTypes — Configure allowed app/extension types
SYNOPSIS: ["hosted_app"]
 Setting the policy controls which apps and extensions may be installed in Google Chrome, which hosts they can interact with, and limits runtime access.

       Leaving the policy unset results in no restrictions on the acceptable extension and app types.

       Extensions and apps which have a type that's not on the list won't be installed. Each value should be one of these strings:

       * "extension"

       * "theme"

       * "user_script"

       * "hosted_app"

       * "legacy_packaged_app"

       * "platform_app"

       See the Google Chrome extensions documentation for more information on these types.

       Versions earlier than 75 that use multiple comma separated extension IDs aren't supported and are skipped. The rest of the policy applies.

** ExtensionAllowInsecureUpdates (DEPRECATED) — Allow insecure algorithms in integrity checks on extension updates and installs
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled means Google Chrome permits installation and updates for extensions hosted outside the Chrome Web Store, the content of which might only be minimally protected.

       Setting the policy to Disabled means Google Chrome won't permit fresh installation of (and updates to) such extensions. The policy has no effect in Google Chrome 78 and later.

 Setting the policy controls extension management settings for Google Chrome, including any controlled by existing extension-related policies. The policy supersedes any legacy policies that might be set.

       This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its specific setting only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID "*", which applies to all extensions without a custom configuration in this policy. With an update URL, configuration applies to extensions with the exact update URL stated in the extension manifest ( http://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=Configure_ExtensionSettings_policy ). If the 'override_update_url' flag is set to true, the extension is installed and updated using the "update" URL specified in the ExtensionInstallForcelist policy or in 'update_url' field in this policy. The flag 'override_update_url' is ignored if the 'update_url' is a Chrome Web Store url.

       Note: For Windows® instances not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

* DefaultSearchProvider — Default search provider
 Configures the default search provider. You can specify the default search provider that the user will use or choose to disable default search.

** DefaultSearchProviderEnabled — Enable the default search provider
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled means a default search is performed when a user enters non-URL text in the address bar. To specify the default search provider, set the rest of the default search policies. If you leave those policies empty, the user can choose the default provider. Setting the policy to Disabled means there's no search when the user enters non-URL text in the address bar.

       If you set the policy, users can't change it in Google Chrome. If not set, the default search provider is on, and users can set the search provider list.

       On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management. On macOS, this functionality is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

** AutoSelectCertificateForUrls — Automatically select client certificates for these sites
SYNOPSIS: ["{\"pattern\":\"https://www.example.com\",\"filter\":{\"ISSUER\":{\"CN\":\"certificate issuer name\", \"L\": \"certificate issuer location\", \"O\": \"certificate issuer org\", \"OU\": \"certificate issuer org unit\"}, \"SUBJECT\":{\"CN\":\"certificate subject name\", \"L\": \"certificate subject location\", \"O\": \"certificate subject org\", \"OU\": \"certificate subject org unit\"}}}"]
 Setting the policy lets you make a list of URL patterns that specify sites for which Chrome can automatically select a client certificate. The value is an array of stringified JSON dictionaries, each with the form { "pattern": "$URL_PATTERN", "filter" : $FILTER }, where $URL_PATTERN is a content setting pattern. $FILTER restricts the client certificates the browser automatically selects from. Independent of the filter, only certificates that match the server's certificate request are selected.

       Examples for the usage of the $FILTER section:

       * When $FILTER is set to { "ISSUER": { "CN": "$ISSUER_CN" } }, only client certificates issued by a certificate with the CommonName $ISSUER_CN are selected.

       * When $FILTER contains both the "ISSUER" and the "SUBJECT" sections, only client certificates that satisfy both conditions are selected.

       * When $FILTER contains a "SUBJECT" section with the "O" value, a certificate needs at least one organization matching the specified value to be selected.

       * When $FILTER contains a "SUBJECT" section with a "OU" value, a certificate needs at least one organizational unit matching the specified value to be selected.

       * When $FILTER is set to {}, the selection of client certificates is not additionally restricted. Note that filters provided by the web server still apply.

       Leaving the policy unset means there's no autoselection for any site.

** JavaScriptJitAllowedForSites — Allow JavaScript to use JIT on these sites
SYNOPSIS: ["[*.]example.edu"]

           For detailed information on valid site url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. * is not an accepted value for this policy.

           JavaScript JIT policy exceptions will only be enforced at a site granularity (eTLD+1). A policy set for only subdomain.site.com will not correctly apply to site.com or subdomain.site.com since they both resolve to the same eTLD+1 (site.com) for which there is no policy. In this case, policy must be set on site.com to apply correctly for both site.com and subdomain.site.com.

           This policy applies on a frame-by-frame basis and not based on top level origin url alone, so e.g. if site-one.com is listed in the JavaScriptJitAllowedForSites policy but site-one.com loads a frame containing site-two.com then site-one.com will have JavaScript JIT enabled, but site-two.com will use the policy from DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting, if set, or default to JavaScript JIT enabled.

           If this policy is not set for a site then the policy from DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting applies to the site, if set, otherwise Javascript JIT is enabled for the site.

           Disabling the JavaScript JIT will mean that Google Chrome may render web content more slowly, and may also disable parts of JavaScript including WebAssembly. Disabling the JavaScript JIT may allow Google Chrome to render web content in a more secure configuration.

           For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. * is not an accepted value for this policy.

           JavaScript JIT policy exceptions will only be enforced at a site granularity (eTLD+1). A policy set for only subdomain.site.com will not correctly apply to site.com or subdomain.site.com since they both resolve to the same eTLD+1 (site.com) for which there is no policy. In this case, policy must be set on site.com to apply correctly for both site.com and subdomain.site.com.

           This policy applies on a frame-by-frame basis and not based on top level origin url alone, so e.g. if site-one.com is listed in the JavaScriptJitBlockedForSites policy but site-one.com loads a frame containing site-two.com then site-one.com will have JavaScript JIT disabled, but site-two.com will use the policy from DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting, if set, or default to JavaScript JIT enabled.

           If this policy is not set for a site then the policy from DefaultJavaScriptJitSetting applies to the site, if set, otherwise JavaScript JIT is enabled for the site.

** LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabled (DEPRECATED) — Default legacy SameSite cookie behavior setting
SYNOPSIS: 1
 This policy is deprecated, if you still require legacy cookie behavior please use LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList. Allows you to revert all cookies to legacy SameSite behavior. Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were "SameSite=None", removes the requirement for "SameSite=None" cookies to carry the "Secure" attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site. See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/cookie-legacy-samesite-policies for full description.

           When this policy is not set, the default SameSite behavior for cookies will depend on the user's personal configuration for the SameSite-by-default feature, the Cookies-without-SameSite-must-be-secure feature, and the Schemeful Same-Site feature which may be set by a field trial or by enabling or disabling the same-site-by-default-cookies flag, the cookies-without-same-site-must-be-secure flag, or the schemeful-same-site flag, respectively.

** LegacySameSiteCookieBehaviorEnabledForDomainList — Revert to legacy SameSite behavior for cookies on these sites
SYNOPSIS: ["www.example.com", "[*.]example.edu"]
 Cookies set for domains matching these patterns will revert to legacy SameSite behavior. Reverting to legacy behavior causes cookies that don't specify a SameSite attribute to be treated as if they were "SameSite=None", removes the requirement for "SameSite=None" cookies to carry the "Secure" attribute, and skips the scheme comparison when evaluating if two sites are same-site. See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/cookie-legacy-samesite-policies for full description.

           For cookies on domains not covered by the patterns specified here, or for all cookies if this policy is not set, the global default value will be the user's personal configuration.

           For detailed information on valid patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.

           Note that patterns you list here are treated as domains, not URLs, so you should not specify a scheme or port.

** RegisteredProtocolHandlers — Register protocol handlers
SYNOPSIS: [{"protocol": "mailto", "url": "https://mail.google.com/mail/?extsrc=mailto&url=%s", "default": true}]
 Setting the policy (as recommended only) lets you register a list of protocol handlers, which merge with the ones that the user registers, putting both sets in use. Set the property "protocol" to the scheme, such as "mailto", and set the property "URL" to the URL pattern of the application that handles the scheme specified in the "protocol" field. The pattern can include a "%s" placeholder, which the handled URL replaces.

       Users can't remove a protocol handler registered by policy. However, by installing a new default handler, they can change the protocol handlers installed by policy.

  arc_support: The protocol handlers set via this policy are not used when handling

** WebUsbAllowDevicesForUrls — Automatically grant permission to these sites to connect to USB devices with the given vendor and product IDs.
SYNOPSIS: [{"devices": [{"vendor_id": 1234, "product_id": 5678}], "urls": ["https://google.com"]}]
 Setting the policy lets you list the URL patterns that specify which sites are automatically granted permission to access a USB device with the given vendor and product IDs. Each item in the list requires both devices and urls fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the devices field can have a vendor_id and product_id field. Omitting the vendor_id field will create a policy matching any device. Omitting the product_id field will create a policy matching any device with the given vendor ID. A policy which has a product_id field without a vendor_id field is invalid.

       The USB permission model will grant the specified URL permission to access the USB device as a top-level origin. If embedded frames need to access USB devices, the 'usb' feature-policy header should be used to grant access. The URL must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored.

       Deprecated: The USB permission model used to support specifying both the requesting and embedding URLs. This is deprecated and only supported for backwards compatiblity in this manner: if both a requesting and embedding URL is specified, then the embedding URL will be granted the permission as top-level origin and the requsting URL will be ignored entirely.

       This policy overrides DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting, WebUsbAskForUrls, WebUsbBlockedForUrls and the user's preferences.

       This policy only affects access to USB devices through the WebUSB API. To grant access to USB devices through the Web Serial API see the SerialAllowUsbDevicesForUrls policy.

** PasswordProtectionLoginURLs — Configure the list of enterprise login URLs where password protection service should capture salted hashes of passwords.
SYNOPSIS: ["https://mydomain.com/login.html", "https://login.mydomain.com"]
 Setting the policy sets the list of enterprise login URLs (HTTP and HTTPS protocols only). Password protection service will capture salted hashes of passwords on these URLs and use them for password reuse detection. For Google Chrome to correctly capture password salted hashes, ensure your sign-in pages follow these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

       Turning this setting off or leaving it unset means the password protection service only captures the password salted hashes on https://accounts.google.com.

SYNOPSIS: "https://mydomain.com/change_password.html"
 Setting the policy sets the URL for users to change their password after seeing a warning in the browser.

For Google Chrome to correctly capture the salted hash of the new password on this change password page, make sure your change password page follows these guidelines ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/create-amazing-password-forms ).

       Turning the policy off or leaving it unset means the service sends users to https://myaccount.google.com to change their password.

* BrowserSwitcher — Legacy Browser Support
 Configure policies to switch between browsers.

       Configured websites will automatically open in another browser than Google Chrome.

** AlternativeBrowserPath — Alternative browser to launch for configured websites.
SYNOPSIS: "${ie}"
 Setting the policy controls which command to use to open URLs in an alternative browser. The policy can be set to one of ${ie}, ${firefox}, ${safari}, ${opera}, ${edge} or a file path. When this policy is set to a file path, that file is used as an executable file. ${ie} is only available on Microsoft® Windows®. ${safari} and ${edge} are only available on Microsoft® Windows® and macOS.

       Leaving the policy unset puts a platform-specific default in use: Internet Explorer® for Microsoft® Windows®, or Safari® for macOS. On Linux®, launching an alternative browser will fail.

  type: string

** AlternativeBrowserParameters — Command-line parameters for the alternative browser.
SYNOPSIS: ["-foreground", "-new-window", "${url}", "-profile", "%HOME%\\browser_profile"]
 Setting the policy to a list of strings means each string is passed to the alternative browser as separate command-line parameters. On Microsoft® Windows®, the parameters are joined with spaces. On macOS and Linux®, a parameter can have spaces and still be treated as a single parameter.

       If an parameter contains ${url}, ${url} is replaced with the URL of the page to open. If no parameter contains ${url}, the URL is appended at the end of the command line.

       Environment variables are expanded. On Microsoft® Windows®, %ABC% is replaced with the value of the ABC environment variable. On macOS and Linux®, ${ABC} is replaced with the value of the ABC environment variable.

       Leaving the policy unset means only the URL is passed as a command-line parameter.

** BrowserSwitcherDelay — Delay before launching alternative browser (milliseconds)
SYNOPSIS: 10000
 Setting the policy to a number has Google Chrome show a message for that number of milliseconds, then it opens an alternative browser.

       Leaving the policy unset or set to 0 means navigating to a designated URL immediately opens it in an alternative browser.

** BrowserSwitcherEnabled — Enable the Legacy Browser Support feature.
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled means Google Chrome will try to launch some URLs in an alternate browser, such as Internet Explorer®. This feature is set using the policies in the Legacy Browser support group.

       Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means Google Chrome won't try to launch designated URLs in an alternate browser.

** BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl — URL of an XML file that contains URLs to load in an alternative browser.
SYNOPSIS: "http://example.com/sitelist.xml"
 Setting the policy to a valid URL has Google Chrome download the site list from that URL and apply the rules as if they were set up with the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy.

       Leaving it unset (or set to a invalid URL) means Google Chrome doesn't use the policy as a source of rules for switching browsers.

       Note: This policy points to an XML file in the same format as Internet Explorer®'s SiteList policy. This loads rules from an XML file, without sharing those rules with Internet Explorer®.

** BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl — URL of an XML file that contains URLs that should never trigger a browser switch.
SYNOPSIS: "http://example.com/greylist.xml"
 Setting the policy to a valid URL has Google Chrome download the site list from that URL and apply the rules as if they were set up with the BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist policy. These policies prevent Google Chrome and the alternative browser from opening one another.

       Leaving it unset (or set to a invalid URL) means Google Chrome doesn't use the policy as a source of rules for not switching browsers.

       Note: This policy points to an XML file in the same format as Internet Explorer®'s SiteList policy. This loads rules from an XML file, without sharing those rules with Internet Explorer®.

** BrowserSwitcherKeepLastChromeTab — Keep last tab open in Chrome.
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset has Google Chrome keep at least one tab open, after switching to an alternate browser.

       Setting the policy to Disabled has Google Chrome close the tab after switching to an alternate browser, even if it was the last tab. This causes Google Chrome to exit completely.

** BrowserSwitcherParsingMode — Sitelist parsing mode
SYNOPSIS: 1
 This policy controls how Google Chrome interprets sitelist/greylist policies for the Legacy Browser Support feature. It affects the following policies: BrowserSwitcherUrlList, BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist, BrowserSwitcherUseIeSitelist, BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl, and BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl.

       If 'Default' (0) or unset, URL matching is less strict. Rules that do not contain "/" look for a substring anywhere in the URL's hostname. Matching the path component of a URL is case-sensitive.

       If 'IESiteListMode' (1), URL matching is more strict. Rules that do not contain "/" only match at the end of the hostname. They must also be at a domain name boundary. Matching the path component of a URL is case-insensitive. This is more compatible with Microsoft® Internet Explorer® and Microsoft® Edge®.

       For example, with the rules "example.com" and "acme.com/abc":

       "http://example.com/", "http://subdomain.example.com/" and "http://acme.com/abc" match regardless of parsing mode.

       "http://notexample.com/", "http://example.com.invalid.com/", "http://example.comabc/" only match in 'Default' mode.

       "http://acme.com/ABC" only matches in 'IESiteListMode'.

** BrowserSwitcherUrlList — Websites to open in alternative browser
SYNOPSIS: ["ie.com", "!open-in-chrome.ie.com", "foobar.com/ie-only/"]
 Setting the policy controls the list of websites to open in an alternative browser. Each item is treated as a rule for something to open in an alternative browser. Google Chrome uses those rules when choosing if a URL should open in an alternative browser. When the Internet Explorer® add-in is on, Internet Explorer® switches back to Google Chrome when the rules don't match. If rules contradict each other, Google Chrome uses the most specific rule.

       Leaving the policy unset adds no websites to the list.

       Note: Elements can also be added to this list through the BrowserSwitcherUseIeSitelist and BrowserSwitcherExternalSitelistUrl policies.

** BrowserSwitcherUrlGreylist — Websites that should never trigger a browser switch.
SYNOPSIS: ["ie.com", "!open-in-chrome.ie.com", "foobar.com/ie-only/"]
 Setting the policy controls the list of websites that will never cause a browser switch. Each item is treated as a rule. Those rules that match won't open an alternative browser. Unlike the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy, rules apply to both directions. When the Internet Explorer® add-in is on, it also controls whether Internet Explorer® should open these URLs in Google Chrome.

       Leaving the policy unset adds no websites to the list.

       Note: Elements can also be added to this list through the BrowserSwitcherExternalGreylistUrl policy.

* Signin — Sign-in settings
 Controls the behavior of the sign-in screen, where users log into their accounts. Settings include who can log in, what type of accounts are allowed, what authentication methods should be used, as well as general accessibility, input method and locale settings.

** DeviceSamlLoginAuthenticationType — SAML login authentication type
SYNOPSIS: 0
 Configures the type of authentication for SAML logins.

       When this policy is unset or set to Default (value 0), the behavior of SAML logins is determined by the browser depending on other factors. In the most basic scenario, the user authentication and the protection of the cached user data are based on passwords manually entered by users.

       When this policy is set to ClientCertificate (value 1), client certificate authentication is used for newly added users which log in via SAML. No passwords are used for such users, and their cached local data is protected using corresponding cryptographic keys. For instance, this setting allows configuring smart card based user authentication (note that smart card middleware apps have to be installed via the DeviceLoginScreenExtensions policy).

       This policy affects only users who authenticate using SAML.

* DeviceUpdate — Device update settings
 Controls how and when Chrome OS updates are applied.

** DeviceChannelDowngradeBehavior — Channel downgrade behavior
SYNOPSIS: 1
 This policy specifies channel downgrade behavior on enrolled devices. With channel downgrade we mean switching to a more stable channel, e.g. beta to stable.

       The value of this policy affects user-initiated channel downgrades as well as admin initiated channel downgrades.

       On a channel downgrade, the device can either roll back its version and reset or wait for its current (or a higher) version to become available on the channel and receive no update until then.

       If an enrolled user initiates a channel downgrade, they can decide to reset or wait, or the choice is made for them depending on this policy's value. If an admin initiates a channel downgrade via setting ChromeOsReleaseChannel, the device is rolled back on the next update check only if rollback was selected. Otherwise, the device will wait for the target channel to catch up with its current version.

       If unset or invalid, the behavior is the same as for "Wait for target channel to catch up on channel downgrade".

** PromptOnMultipleMatchingCertificates — Prompt for the client certificate when multiple certificates match.
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy controls whether the user is prompted to select a client certificate when more than one certificate matches AutoSelectCertificateForUrls.
       If this policy is set to Enabled, the user is prompted to select a client certificate whenever the auto-selection policy matches multiple certificates.

** CloudPrintSubmitEnabled — Enable submission of documents to Google Cloud Print
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset lets users print to Google Cloud Print from the Google Chrome print dialog. Google Chrome can submit documents to Google Cloud Print for printing. This doesn't prevent users from submitting print jobs on websites.

       Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't print to Google Cloud Print from the Google Chrome print dialog.

       In order to keep Google Cloud Print destinations discoverable, this policy must be set to Enabled and cloud must not be included in the PrinterTypeDenyList policy.

  schema:
    type: boolean
  supported_on:
  - chrome.*:17-
  type: main

** DisablePrintPreview — Disable Print Preview
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled has Google Chrome open the system print dialog instead of the built-in print preview when users request a printout.

       Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset has print commands trigger the print preview screen.

  features:

** PrintHeaderFooter — Print Headers and Footers
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled turns headers and footers on in print preview. Setting the policy to Disabled turns them off in print preview.

       If you set the policy, users can't change it. If unset, users decides whether headers and footers appear.

** DefaultPrinterSelection — Default printer selection rules
SYNOPSIS: "{ \"kind\": \"cloud\", \"idPattern\": \".*public\", \"namePattern\": \".*Color\" }"
 Setting the policy sets the rules for selecting the default printer in Google Chrome, overriding the default rules. Printer selection occurs the first time users try to print, when Google Chrome seeks a printer matching the specified attributes. In case of a less than perfect match, Google Chrome can be set to select any matching printer, depending on the order printers are discovered.

       Leaving the policy unset or set to attributes for which there's no match means the built-in PDF printer is the default. If there's no PDF printer, Google Chrome defaults to none.

       Printers connected to Google Cloud Print are considered "cloud", the rest of the printers are classified as "local".

       Note: Omitting a field means all values match. For example, not specifying connectivity causes Print Preview to start discovery of all kinds of printers, "local" and "cloud". Regular expression patterns must follow the JavaScript RegExp syntax, and matches are case sensistive.

** PrintPreviewUseSystemDefaultPrinter — Use System Default Printer as Default
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled means Google Chrome uses the OS default printer as the default destination for print preview.

       Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means Google Chrome uses the most recently used printer as the default destination for print preview.

** DeviceExternalPrintServers — External print servers
SYNOPSIS: {"url": "https://example.com/printserverpolicy", "hash": "deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeafdeadbeefdeadbeef"}
 Provides configurations of available print servers.

       This policy allows you to provide configuration of external print servers to Google Chrome OS devices as JSON file.

       The size of the file must not exceed 1MB and must contain an array of records (JSON objects). Each record must contain fields "id", "url" and "display_name" with strings as values. Values of "id" fields must be unique.

       The file is downloaded and cached. The cryptographic hash is used to verify the integrity of the download. The file will be re-downloaded whenever the URL or the hash changes.

       When this policy is set to correct value, devices will try to query specified print servers for available printers using IPP protocol.

       If this policy is unset or set to incorrect value, none of the provided server printers are visible to users.

       Currently, the number of print servers is limited to 16. Only the first 16 print servers from the list will be queried.

       This policy is similar to ExternalPrintServers, except this policy is applied by device.

** DeviceExternalPrintServersAllowlist — Enabled external print servers
SYNOPSIS: ["id1", "id2", "id3"]
 Specifies the subset of print servers that will be queried for server printers. This applies only to the DeviceExternalPrintServers policy.

       If this policy is used, only the server printers with ids matching the values in this policy are available to the user through device policy.

       The ids must correspond to the "id" field in the file specified in DeviceExternalPrintServers.

       If this policy is not set, filtering is omitted and all print servers provided by DeviceExternalPrintServers are taken into account.

** PrinterTypeDenyList — Disable printer types on the deny list
SYNOPSIS: ["cloud", "privet"]
 The printers of types placed on the deny list will be disabled from being discovered or having their capabilities fetched.

       Placing all printer types on the deny list effectively disables printing, as there would be no available destinations to send a document for printing.

       Including cloud on the deny list has the same effect as setting the CloudPrintSubmitEnabled policy to false. In order to keep Google Cloud Print destinations discoverable, the CloudPrintSubmitEnabled policy must be set to true and cloud must not be on the deny list.

       If the policy is not set, or is set to an empty list, all printer types will be available for discovery.

       Extension printers are also known as print provider destinations, and include any destination that belongs to a Google Chrome extension.

       Local printers are also known as native printing destinations, and include destinations available to the local machine and shared network printers.

** PrintRasterizePdfDpi — Print Rasterize PDF DPI
SYNOPSIS: 300
 Controls print image resolution when Google Chrome prints PDFs with rasterization.

       When printing a PDF using the Print to image option, it can be beneficial to specify a print resolution other than a device's printer setting or the PDF default.  A high resolution will significantly increase the processing and printing time while a low resolution can lead to poor imaging quality.

       This policy allows a particular resolution to be specified for use when rasterizing PDFs for printing.

       If this policy is set to zero or not set at all then the system default resolution will be used during rasterization of page images.

** PrintPdfAsImageDefault — Print PDF as Image Default
SYNOPSIS: true
 Controls if Google Chrome makes the Print as image option default to set when printing PDFs.

       When this policy is set to Enabled, Google Chrome will default to setting the Print as image option in the Print Preview when printing a PDF.

       When this policy is set to Disabled or not set Google Chrome then the user selection for Print as image option will be initially unset.  The user will be allowed to select it for each individual PDFs print job, if the option is available.

       For Microsoft® Windows® or macOS this policy only has an effect if PrintPdfAsImageAvailability is also enabled.

 FIXME

** DefaultBrowserSettingEnabled — Set Google Chrome as Default Browser
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to True has Google Chrome always check whether it's the default browser on startup and, if possible, automatically register itself. Setting the policy to False stops Google Chrome from ever checking if it's the default and turns user controls off for this option.

       Leaving the policy unset means Google Chrome lets users control whether it's the default and, if not, whether user notifications should appear.

       Note: For Microsoft®Windows® administrators, turning this setting on only works for machines running Windows 7. For later versions, you must deploy a "default application associations" file that makes Google Chrome the handler for the https and http protocols (and, optionally, the ftp protocol and other file formats).

** GloballyScopeHTTPAuthCacheEnabled — Enable globally scoped HTTP auth cache
SYNOPSIS: false
 This policy configures a single global per profile cache with HTTP server authentication credentials.

       If this policy is unset or disabled, the browser will use the default behavior of cross-site auth, which as of version 80, will be to scope HTTP server authentication credentials by top-level site, so if two sites use resources from the same authenticating domain, credentials will need to be provided independently in the context of both sites. Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

       If the policy is enabled, HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another.

       Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

       This policy is intended to give enterprises depending on the legacy behavior a chance to update their login procedures, and will be removed in the future.

** DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled — DNS interception checks enabled
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy configures a local switch that can be used to disable DNS interception checks. The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

       This detection may not be necessary in an enterprise environment where the network configuration is known, since it causes some amount of DNS and HTTP traffic on start-up and each DNS configuration change.

       When this policy is not set, or is enabled, the DNS interception checks are performed. When explicitly disabled, they're not.

** IntranetRedirectBehavior — Intranet Redirection Behavior
SYNOPSIS: 1
 This policy configures behavior for intranet redirection via DNS interception checks. The checks attempt to discover whether the browser is behind a proxy that redirects unknown host names.

       If this policy is not set, the browser will use the default behavior of DNS interception checks and intranet redirect suggestions. In M88, they are enabled by default but will be disabled by default in the future release.

       DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled is a related policy that may also disable DNS interception checks; this policy is a more flexible version which may separately control intranet redirection infobars and may be expanded in the future.
       If either DNSInterceptionChecksEnabled or this policy requests to disable interception checks, the checks will be disabled.

       Chrome's default referrer policy is being strengthened from its current value of no-referrer-when-downgrade to the more secure strict-origin-when-cross-origin through a gradual rollout targeting Chrome 85 stable.

       Before the rollout, this enterprise policy will have no effect. After the rollout, when this enterprise policy is enabled, Chrome's default referrer policy will be set to its previous value of no-referrer-when-downgrade.

** DisabledPlugins (DEPRECATED) — Specify a list of disabled plugins
SYNOPSIS: ["Java", "Shockwave Flash", "Chrome PDF Viewer"]
 This policy is deprecated. Please use the DefaultPluginsSetting to control the availability of the Flash plugin and AlwaysOpenPdfExternally to control whether the integrated PDF viewer should be used for opening PDF files.

       Specifies a list of plugins that are disabled in Google Chrome and prevents users from changing this setting.

       The wildcard characters '*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary characters. '*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters. The escape character is '\', so to match actual '*', '?', or '\' characters, you can put a '\' in front of them.

       If you enable this setting, the specified list of plugins is never used in Google Chrome. The plugins are marked as disabled in 'about:plugins' and users cannot enable them.

       Note that this policy can be overridden by EnabledPlugins and DisabledPluginsExceptions.

SYNOPSIS: ["Java", "Shockwave Flash", "Chrome PDF Viewer"]
 This policy is deprecated. Please use the DefaultPluginsSetting to control the availability of the Flash plugin and AlwaysOpenPdfExternally to control whether the integrated PDF viewer should be used for opening PDF files.

       Specifies a list of plugins that user can enable or disable in Google Chrome.

       The wildcard characters '*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary characters. '*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters. The escape character is '\', so to match actual '*', '?', or '\' characters, you can put a '\' in front of them.

       If you enable this setting, the specified list of plugins can be used in Google Chrome. Users can enable or disable them in 'about:plugins', even if the plugin also matches a pattern in DisabledPlugins. Users can also enable and disable plugins that don't match any patterns in DisabledPlugins, DisabledPluginsExceptions and EnabledPlugins.

       This policy is meant to allow for strict plugin blocking where the 'DisabledPlugins' list contains wildcarded entries like disable all plugins '*' or disable all Java plugins '*Java*' but the administrator wishes to enable some particular version like 'IcedTea Java 2.3'. This particular versions can be specified in this policy.

       Note that both the plugin name and the plugin's group name have to be exempted. Each plugin group is shown in a separate section in about:plugins; each section may have one or more plugins. For example, the "Shockwave Flash" plugin belongs to the "Adobe Flash Player" group, and both names have to have a match in the exceptions list if that plugin is to be exempted from the blocklist.

       If this policy is left not set any plugin that matches the patterns in the 'DisabledPlugins' will be locked disabled and the user won't be able to enable them.

 If you enable this setting, the settings stored in Google Chrome profiles like bookmarks, autofill data, passwords, etc. will also be written to a file stored in the Roaming user profile folder or a location specified by the Administrator through the RoamingProfileLocation policy. Enabling this policy disables cloud sync.

       If this policy is disabled or left not set only the regular local profiles will be used.

** RoamingProfileLocation — Set the roaming profile directory
SYNOPSIS: "${roaming_app_data}\\chrome-profile"
 Configures the directory that Google Chrome will use for storing the roaming copy of the profiles.

       If you set this policy, Google Chrome will use the provided directory to store the roaming copy of the profiles if the RoamingProfileSupportEnabled policy has been enabled. If the RoamingProfileSupportEnabled policy is disabled or left unset the value stored in this policy is not used.

       See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables for a list of variables that can be used.

       On non-Windows platforms, this policy must be set for roaming profiles to work.

       On Windows, if this policy is left unset, the default roaming profile path will be used.

** SigninAllowed (DEPRECATED) — Allow sign in to Google Chrome
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy is deprecated, consider using BrowserSignin instead.

       Allows the user to sign in to Google Chrome.

       If you set this policy, you can configure whether a user is allowed to sign in to Google Chrome. Setting this policy to 'False' will prevent apps and extensions that use the chrome.identity API from functioning, so you may want to use SyncDisabled instead.

** EnableDeprecatedWebBasedSignin (DEPRECATED) — Enable the old web-based signin flow
SYNOPSIS: false
 This setting was named EnableWebBasedSignin prior to Chrome 42, and support for it will be removed entirely in Chrome 43.

       This setting is useful for enterprise customers who are using SSO solutions that are not compatible with the new inline signin flow yet.
       If you enable this setting, the old web-based signin flow would be used.
       If you disable this setting or leave it not set, the new inline signin flow would be used by default. Users may still enable the old web-based signin flow through the command line flag --enable-web-based-signin.

       The experimental setting will be removed in the future when the inline signin fully supports all SSO signin flows.

** DiskCacheDir — Set disk cache directory
SYNOPSIS: "${user_home}/Chrome_cache"
 Setting the policy has Google Chrome use the directory you provide for storing cached files on the disk—whether or not users specify the --disk-cache-dir flag.

       If not set, Google Chrome uses the default cache directory, but users can change that setting with the --disk-cache-dir command line flag.

       Google Chrome manages the contents of a volume's root directory. So to avoid data loss or other errors, do not set this policy to the root directory or any directory used for other purposes. See the variables you can use ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables ).

** DiskCacheSize — Set disk cache size in bytes
SYNOPSIS: 104857600
 Setting the policy to None has Google Chrome use the default cache size for storing cached files on the disk. Users can't change it.

       If you set the policy, Google Chrome uses the cache size you provide—whether or not users specify the --disk-cache-size flag. (Values below a few megabytes are rounded up.)

       If not set, Google Chrome uses the default size. Users can change that setting using the --disk-cache-size flag.

       Note: The value specified in this policy is used as a hint to various cache subsystems in the browser. Therefore the actual total disk consumption of all caches will be higher but within the same order of magnitude as the value specified.

** MediaCacheSize (DEPRECATED) — Set media disk cache size in bytes
SYNOPSIS: 104857600
 Setting the policy configures the cache size that Google Chrome uses for storing cached media files on the disk, regardless of whether or not users specify the --media-cache-size flag. The value specified in this policy isn't a hard boundary, but a suggestion to the caching system. Any value below a few megabytes is rounded up.

       Setting the value of the policy to 0 uses the default cache size, and users can't change it.

       Leaving the policy unset uses the default cache size and users can change it with the --media-cache-size flag.

** DownloadRestrictions — Allow download restrictions
SYNOPSIS: 4
 Setting the policy means users can't bypass download security decisions.

       There are many types of download warnings within Chrome, which roughly break down into these categories (learn more about Safe Browsing verdicts https://support.google.com/chrome/?p=ib_download_blocked):

       * Malicious, as flagged by the Safe Browsing server
       * Uncommon or unwanted, as flagged by the Safe Browsing server
       * A dangerous file type (e.g. all SWF downloads and many EXE downloads)

       Setting the policy blocks different subsets of these, depending on it's value:

       0: No special restrictions. Default.

       1: Blocks malicious files flagged by the Safe Browsing server AND Blocks all dangerous file types. Only recommended for OUs/browsers/users that have a high tolerance for False Positives.

       2: Blocks malicious files flagged by the Safe Browsing server AND Blocks uncommon or unwanted files flagged by the Safe Browsing server AND Blocks all dangerous file types. Only recommended for OUs/browsers/users that have a high tolerance for False Positives.

       3: Blocks all downloads. Not recommended, except for special use cases.

       4: Blocks malicious files flagged by the Safe Browsing server, does not block dangerous file types. Recommended.

       Note: These restrictions apply to downloads triggered from webpage content, as well as the Download link... menu option. They don't apply to the download of the currently displayed page or to saving as PDF from the printing options. Read more about Safe Browsing ( https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing ).

** DownloadDirectory — Set download directory
SYNOPSIS: "/home/${user_name}/Downloads"
 Setting the policy sets up the directory Chrome uses for downloading files. It uses the provided directory, whether or not users specify one or turned on the flag to be prompted for download location every time.

       Leaving the policy unset means Chrome uses the default download directory, and users can change it.

       Note: See a list of variables you can use ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables ).

  arc_support: This policy has no effect on Android apps. Android apps always use the
    default downloads directory and cannot access any files downloaded by Google Chrome
    OS into a non-default downloads directory.

** AutoOpenFileTypes — List of file types that should be automatically opened on download
SYNOPSIS: ["exe", "txt"]
 List of file types that should be automatically opened on download. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type, so list "txt" instead of ".txt".

       Files with types that should be automatically opened will still be subject to the enabled safe browsing checks and won't be opened if they fail those checks.

       If this policy isn't set, only file types that a user has already specified to automatically be opened will do so when downloaded.

       On Microsoft® Windows®, this functionality is only available on instances that are joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, running on Windows 10 Pro, or enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management. On macOS, this functionality is only available on instances that are managed via MDM, or joined to a domain via MCX.

** AutoOpenAllowedForURLs — URLs where AutoOpenFileTypes can apply
SYNOPSIS: ["example.com", "https://ssl.server.com", "hosting.com/good_path", "https://server:8080/path", ".exact.hostname.com"]
 List of URLs specifying which urls AutoOpenFileTypes will apply to. This policy has no impact on automatically open values set by users.

       If this policy is set, files will only automatically open by policy if the url is part of this set and the file type is listed in AutoOpenFileTypes. If either condition is false the download won't automatically open by policy.

       If this policy isn't set, all downloads where the file type is in AutoOpenFileTypes will automatically open.

       A URL pattern has to be formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blocklist-filter-format.

** AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins — Define a list of protocols that can launch an external application from listed origins without prompting the user
SYNOPSIS: [{"protocol": "spotify", "allowed_origins": ["example.com", "http://www.example.com:8080"]}, {"protocol": "teams", "allowed_origins": ["https://example.com", "https://.mail.example.com"]}, {"protocol": "outlook", "allowed_origins": ["*"]}]
 Allows you to set a list of protocols, and for each protocol an associated list of allowed origin patterns, that can launch an external application without prompting the user. The trailing separator should not be included when listing the protocol, so list "skype" instead of "skype:" or "skype://".

       If this policy is set, a protocol will only be permitted to launch an external application without prompting by policy if the protocol is listed, and the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list. If either condition is false the external protocol launch prompt will not be omitted by policy.

       If this policy is not set, no protocols can launch without a prompt by default. Users may opt out of prompts on a per-protocol/per-site basis unless the ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox policy is set to Disabled. This policy has no impact on per-protocol/per-site prompt exemptions set by users.

       The origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the 'URLBlocklist' policy, which are documented at http://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blocklist-filter-format.

       However, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain "/path" or "@query" elements. Any pattern that does contain a "/path" or "@query" element will be ignored.

** ProxySettings — Proxy settings
SYNOPSIS: {"ProxyMode": "fixed_servers", "ProxyServer": "123.123.123.123:8080", "ProxyBypassList": "https://www.example1.com,https://www.example2.com,https://internalsite/"}
 Setting the policy configures the proxy settings for Chrome and ARC-apps, which ignore all proxy-related options specified from the command line.

        Leaving the policy unset lets users choose their proxy settings.

        Setting the ProxySettings policy accepts the following fields:
          * ProxyMode, which lets you specify the proxy server Chrome uses and prevents users from changing proxy settings
          * ProxyPacUrl, a URL to a proxy .pac file
          * ProxyPacMandatory, which prevents the network stack from falling back to direct connections with invalid or unavailable PAC script
          * ProxyServer, a URL of the proxy server
          * ProxyBypassList, a list of hosts for which the proxy will be bypassed

        The ProxyServerMode field is deprecated in favor of the ProxyMode field.

         For ProxyMode, if you choose the value:
           * direct, a proxy is never used and all other fields are ignored.
           * system, the systems's proxy is used and all other fields are ignored.
           * auto_detect, all other fields are ignored.
           * fixed_servers, the ProxyServer and ProxyBypassList fields are used.
           * pac_script, the ProxyPacUrl, ProxyPacMandatory and ProxyBypassList fields are used.

       Note: For more detailed examples, visit The Chromium Projects ( https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings#TOC-Command-line-options-for-proxy-sett ).

  arc_support: Only a subset of proxy configuration options are made available to Android
    apps. Android apps may voluntarily choose to use the proxy. You cannot force them
    to use a proxy.

** DeveloperToolsDisabled (DEPRECATED) — Disable Developer Tools
SYNOPSIS: false
 This policy is deprecated in M68, please use DeveloperToolsAvailability instead.

       Disables the Developer Tools and the JavaScript console.

       If you enable this setting, the Developer Tools can not be accessed and web-site elements can not be inspected anymore. Any keyboard shortcuts and any menu or context menu entries to open the Developer Tools or the JavaScript Console will be disabled.

       Setting this option to disabled or leaving it not set allows the user to use the Developer Tools and the JavaScript console.

       If the policy DeveloperToolsAvailability is set, the value of the policy DeveloperToolsDisabled is ignored.

  arc_support: This policy also controls access to Android Developer Options. If you
    set this policy to true, users cannot access Developer Options. If you set this

** DeveloperToolsAvailability — Control where Developer Tools can be used
SYNOPSIS: 2
 Setting the policy to 0 (the default) means you can access the developer tools and the JavaScript console, but not in the context of extensions installed by enterprise policy. Setting the policy to 1 means you can access the developer tools and the JavaScript console in all contexts, including that of extensions installed by enterprise policy. Setting the policy to 2 means you can't acess developer tools, and you can't inspect website elements.

       This setting also turns off keyboard shortcuts and menu or context menu entries to open developer tools or the JavaScript console.

  arc_support: This policy also controls access to Android Developer Options. If you
    set this policy to 'DeveloperToolsDisallowed' (value 2), users cannot access Developer

** InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed — Specifies whether to allow insecure websites to make requests to more-private network endpoints
SYNOPSIS: false
 Controls whether insecure websites are allowed to make requests to more-private network endpoints.

           This policy relates to the Private Network Access specification. See https://wicg.github.io/private-network-access/ for more details.

           A network endpoint is more private than another if:
           1) Its IP address is localhost and the other is not.
           2) Its IP address is private and the other is public.
           In the future, depending on spec evolution, this policy might apply to all cross-origin requests directed at private IPs or localhost.

           A website is deemed secure if it meets the definition of a secure context in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts. Otherwise, it will be treated as an insecure context.

           When this policy is either not set or set to false, the default behavior for requests from insecure contexts to more-private network endpoints will depend on the user's personal configuration for the BlockInsecurePrivateNetworkRequests feature, which may be set by a field trial or on the command line.

           When this policy is set to true, insecure websites are allowed to make requests to any network endpoint, subject to other cross-origin checks.

** InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls — Allow the listed sites to make requests to more-private network endpoints from insecure contexts.
SYNOPSIS: ["http://www.example.com:8080", "[*.]example.edu"]
 List of URL patterns. Private network requests initiated from insecure websites served by matching origins are allowed.

           If unset, this policy behaves as if set to the empty list.

           For origins not covered by the patterns specified here, the global default value will be used either from the InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowed policy, if it is set, or the user's personal configuration otherwise.

           Note that this policy only affects insecure origins, so secure origins (e.g. https://example.com) included in this list will be ignored.

           For detailed information on valid URL patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.

** Disable3DAPIs — Disable support for 3D graphics APIs

** PolicyRefreshRate — Refresh rate for user policy
SYNOPSIS: 3600000
 Setting the policy specifies the period in milliseconds at which the device management service is queried for user policy information. Valid values range from 1,800,000 (30 minutes) to 86,400,000 (1 day). Values outside this range will be clamped to the respective boundary.

       Leaving the policy unset uses the default value of 3 hours.

       Note: Policy notifications force a refresh when the policy changes, making frequent refreshes unnecessary. So, if the platform supports these notifications, the refresh delay is 24 hours (ignoring defaults and the value of this policy).

SYNOPSIS: ["https://example.com"]
 Setting the policy specifies URLs and domains for which no prompt appears when attestation certificates from Security Keys are requested. A signal is also sent to the Security Key indicating that individual attestation may be used. Without this, when sites request attestation of Security Keys, users are prompted in Google Chrome version 65 and later.

       URLs will only match as U2F appIDs. Domains only match as webauthn RP IDs. So to cover both U2F and webauthn APIs, list the appID URL and domain for a given site.

** MaxConnectionsPerProxy — Maximal number of concurrent connections to the proxy server
SYNOPSIS: 32
 Setting the policy specifies the maximal number of simultaneous connections to the proxy server. Some proxy servers can't handle a high number of concurrent connections per client, which is solved by setting this policy to a lower value. The value should be lower than 100 and higher than 6. Some web apps are known to consume many connections with hanging GETs, so setting a value below 32 may lead to browser networking hangs if there are too many web apps with hanging connections open. Lower below the default at your own risk.

       Leaving the policy unset means a default of 32 is used.

 This policy is deprecated, please use the 'URLBlocklist' policy instead.

       Setting the policy prevents webpages with prohibited URLs from loading. It provides a list of URL patterns that specify forbidden URLs. Leaving the policy unset means no URLs are prohibited in the browser. Format the URL pattern according to this format ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blocklist-filter-format ). Up to 1,000 exceptions can be defined in URLAllowlist.

       From Google Chrome version 73, you can block javascript://* URLs. However, it affects only JavaScript entered in the address bar (or, for example, bookmarklets). In-page JavaScript URLs with dynamically loaded data aren't subject to this policy. For example, if you block example.com/abc, then example.com can still load example.com/abc using XMLHTTPRequest.

         An experimental policy may not be finished or still have known or unknown defects. It may be changed or even removed without any notification. By enabling experimental policies, you could lose browser data or compromise your security or privacy.

         If a policy is not in the list and it's not officially released, its value will be ignored on Beta and Stable channel.

         If a policy is in the list and it's not officially released, its value will be applied.

         This policy has no effect on already released policies.

** EnterpriseWebStoreURL (DEPRECATED) — Enterprise web store URL (deprecated)
SYNOPSIS: "https://company-intranet/chromeapps"
 This setting has been retired as of Google Chrome version 29. The recommended way to set up organization-hosted extension/app collections is to include the site hosting the CRX packages in ExtensionInstallSources and put direct download links to the packages on a web page. A launcher for that web page can be created using the ExtensionInstallForcelist policy.

SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to True means online OCSP/CRL checks are performed.

       Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset means Google Chrome won't perform online revocation checks in Google Chrome 19 and later.

       Note: OCSP/CRL checks provide no effective security benefit.

** RequireOnlineRevocationChecksForLocalAnchors — Require online OCSP/CRL checks for local trust anchors
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to True means Google Chrome always performs revocation checking for successfully validated server certificates signed by locally installed CA certificates. If Google Chrome can't get revocation status information, Google Chrome treats these certificates as revoked (hard-fail).

       Setting the policy to False or leaving it unset means Google Chrome uses existing online revocation-checking settings.

** EnableSha1ForLocalAnchors (DEPRECATED) — Allow SHA-1 signed certificates issued by local trust anchors
SYNOPSIS: false
 When this setting is enabled, Google Chrome allows SHA-1 signed certificates as long as they successfully validate and chain to a locally-installed CA certificates.

       Note that this policy depends on the operating system certificate verification stack allowing SHA-1 signatures. If an OS update changes the OS handling of SHA-1 certificates, this policy may no longer have effect.  Further, this policy is intended as a temporary workaround to give enterprises more time to move away from SHA-1.  This policy will be removed on or around January 1st 2019.

       If this policy is not set, or it is set to false, then Google Chrome follows the publicly announced SHA-1 deprecation schedule.

** EnableCommonNameFallbackForLocalAnchors (DEPRECATED) — Allow certificates issued by local trust anchors without subjectAlternativeName extension
SYNOPSIS: false
 When this setting is enabled, Google Chrome will use the commonName of a server certificate to match a hostname if the certificate is missing a subjectAlternativeName extension, as long as it successfully validates and chains to a locally-installed CA certificates.

       Note that this is not recommended, as this may allow bypassing the nameConstraints extension that restricts the hostnames that a given certificate can be authorized for.

       If this policy is not set, or is set to false, server certificates that lack a subjectAlternativeName extension containing either a DNS name or IP address will not be trusted.

** EnableSymantecLegacyInfrastructure (DEPRECATED) — Enable trust in Symantec Corporation's Legacy PKI Infrastructure
SYNOPSIS: false
 When this setting is enabled, Google Chrome allows certificates issued by Symantec Corporation's Legacy PKI operations to be trusted if they otherwise successfully validate and chain to a recognized CA certificate.

       Note that this policy depends on the operating system still recognizing certificates from Symantec's legacy infrastructure. If an OS update changes the OS handling of such certificates, this policy no longer has effect.  Further, this policy is intended as a temporary workaround to give enterprises more time to transition away from legacy Symantec certificates.  This policy will be removed on or around January 1st 2019.

       If this policy is not set, or it is set to false, then Google Chrome follows the publicly announced deprecation schedule.

** BuiltinCertificateVerifierEnabled — Determines whether the built-in certificate verifier will be used to verify server certificates
SYNOPSIS: false
 When this setting is enabled, Google Chrome will perform verification of server certificates using the built-in certificate verifier.
       When this setting is disabled, Google Chrome will perform verification of server certificates using the legacy certificate verifier provided by the platform.
       When this setting is not set, the built-in or the legacy certificate verifier may be used.

       This policy is planned to be removed in Google Chrome OS version 81, when support for the legacy certificate verifier on Google Chrome OS is planned to be removed.

       This policy is planned to be removed in Google Chrome for Linux version 83, when support for the legacy certificate verifier on Linux is planned to be removed.

       This policy is planned to be removed in Google Chrome for Mac OS X version 92, when support for the legacy certificate verifier on Mac OS X is planned to be removed.

** ForceEphemeralProfiles — Ephemeral profile
SYNOPSIS: true
 If set to enabled this policy forces the profile to be switched to ephemeral mode. If this policy is specified as an OS policy (e.g. GPO on Windows) it will apply to every profile on the system; if the policy is set as a Cloud policy it will apply only to a profile signed in with a managed account.

       In this mode the profile data is persisted on disk only for the length of the user session. Features like browser history, extensions and their data, web data like cookies and web databases are not preserved after the browser is closed. However this does not prevent the user from downloading any data to disk manually, save pages or print them.

       If the user has enabled sync all this data is preserved in their sync profile just like with regular profiles. Incognito mode is also available if not explicitly disabled by policy.

       If the policy is set to disabled or left not set signing in leads to regular profiles.

** BackgroundModeEnabled — Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled turns background mode on. In background mode, a Google Chrome process is started on OS sign-in and keeps running when the last browser window is closed, allowing background apps and the browsing session to remain active. The background process displays an icon in the system tray and can always be closed from there.

       Setting the policy to Disabled turns background mode off.

       If you set the policy, users can't change it in the browser settings. If unset, background mode is off at first, but users can change it.

Disabling SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingOptInAllowed is equivalent to disabling SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled. Enabling SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingOptInAllowed or leaving this setting unset is equivalent to leaving SafeBrowsingExtendedReportingEnabled unset.

       Setting this policy to false stops users from choosing to send some system information and page content to Google servers. If this setting is true or not configured, then users will be allowed to send some system information and page content to Safe Browsing to help detect dangerous apps and sites.

** BuiltInDnsClientEnabled — Use built-in DNS client
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy controls which software stack is used to communicate with the DNS server: the Operating System DNS client, or Google Chrome's built-in DNS client. This policy does not affect which DNS servers are used: if, for example, the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It also does not control if DNS-over-HTTPS is used; Google Chrome will always use the built-in resolver for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. Please see the DnsOverHttpsMode policy for information on controlling DNS-over-HTTPS.

       If this policy is set to Enabled, the built-in DNS client will be used, if available.

       If this policy is set to Disabled, the built-in DNS client will only be used when DNS-over-HTTPS is in use.

       If this policy is left unset, the built-in DNS client will be enabled by default on macOS, Android (when neither Private DNS nor VPN are enabled) and Google Chrome OS.

** DnsOverHttpsMode — Controls the mode of DNS-over-HTTPS
SYNOPSIS: "off"
 Controls the mode of the DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. Please note that this policy will only set the default mode for each query. The mode may be overridden for special types of queries such as requests to resolve a DNS-over-HTTPS server hostname.

       The "off" mode will disable DNS-over-HTTPS.

       The "automatic" mode will send DNS-over-HTTPS queries first if a DNS-over-HTTPS server is available and may fallback to sending insecure queries on error.

       The "secure" mode will only send DNS-over-HTTPS queries and will fail to resolve on error.

       On Android Pie and above, if DNS-over-TLS is active, Google Chrome will not send insecure DNS requests.

       If this policy is unset the browser may send DNS-over-HTTPS requests to a resolver associated with the user's configured system resolver.

 The URI template of the desired DNS-over-HTTPS resolver. To specify multiple DNS-over-HTTPS resolvers, separate the corresponding URI templates with spaces.

       If the DnsOverHttpsMode is set to "secure" then this policy must be set and not empty.

       If the DnsOverHttpsMode is set to "automatic" and this policy is set then the URI templates specified will be used; if this policy is unset then hardcoded mappings will be used to attempt to upgrade the user's current DNS resolver to a DoH resolver operated by the same provider.

       If the URI template contains a dns variable, requests to the resolver will use GET; otherwise requests will use POST.

       Incorrectly formatted templates will be ignored.

 This policy controls whether Google Chrome may query additional DNS record types when making insecure DNS requests. This policy has no effect on DNS queries made via Secure DNS, which may always query additional DNS types.

       If this policy is unset or set to Enabled, additional types such as HTTPS (DNS type 65) may be queried in addition to A (DNS type 1) and AAAA (DNS type 28).

       If this policy is set to Disabled, DNS will only be queried for A (DNS type 1) and/or AAAA (DNS type 28).

       This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed in future versions of Google Chrome. After removal of the policy, Google Chrome will always be able to query additional DNS types.

SYNOPSIS: 1
 Configuring this policy allows to specify which variations are allowed to be applied in Google Chrome.

       Variations provide a means for offering modifications to Google Chrome without shipping a new version of the browser by selectively enabling or disabling already existing features. See https://support.google.com/chrome/a?p=Manage_the_Chrome_variations_framework for more information.

       Setting the VariationsEnabled (value 0), or leaving the policy not set allows all variations to be applied to the browser.

       Setting the CriticalFixesOnly (value 1), allows only variations considered critical security or stability fixes to be applied to Google Chrome.

       Setting the VariationsDisabled (value 2), prevent all variations from being applied to the browser. Please note that this mode can potentially prevent the Google Chrome developers from providing critical security fixes in a timely manner and is thus not recommended.

 Setting the policy sets up a list of bookmarks where each one is a dictionary with the keys "name" and "url". These keys hold the bookmark's name and target. Admins can set up a subfolder by defining a bookmark without a "url" key, but with an additional "children" key. This key also has a list of bookmarks, some of which can also be folders. Chrome amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted through the address bar. For example, "google.com" becomes "https://google.com/".

       Users can't change the folders the bookmarks are placed in (though they can hide it from the bookmark bar). The default folder name for managed bookmarks is "Managed bookmarks" but it can be changed by adding a new sub-dictionary to the policy with a single key named "toplevel_name" with the desired folder name as its value. Managed bookmarks are not synced to the user account and extensions can't modify them.

** EnableDeprecatedWebPlatformFeatures (DEPRECATED) — Enable deprecated web platform features for a limited time
SYNOPSIS: ["ExampleDeprecatedFeature_EffectiveUntil20080902"]
 Specify a list of deprecated web platform features to re-enable temporarily.

       This policy gives administrators the ability to re-enable deprecated web platform features for a limited time. Features are identified by a string tag and the features corresponding to the tags included in the list specified by this policy will get re-enabled.

       If this policy is left not set, or the list is empty or does not match one of the supported string tags, all deprecated web platform features will remain disabled.

       While the policy itself is supported on the above platforms, the feature it is enabling may be available on fewer platforms. Not all deprecated Web Platform features can be re-enabled. Only the ones explicitly listed below can be for a limited period of time, which is different per feature. The general format of the string tag will be [DeprecatedFeatureName]_EffectiveUntil[yyyymmdd]. As reference, you can find the intent behind the Web Platform feature changes at https://bit.ly/blinkintents.

** BrowserGuestModeEnabled — Enable guest mode in browser
SYNOPSIS: true
 If this policy is set to true or not configured, Google Chrome will enable guest logins. Guest logins are Google Chrome profiles where all windows are in incognito mode.

       If this policy is set to false, Google Chrome will not allow guest profiles to be started.

** BrowserSignin — Browser sign in settings
SYNOPSIS: 2
 This policy controls the sign-in behavior of the browser. It allows you to specify if the user can sign in to Google Chrome with their account and use account related services like Google Chrome Sync.

       If the policy is set to "Disable browser sign-in" then the user cannot sign in to the browser and use account-based services. In this case browser-level features like Google Chrome Sync cannot be used and will be unavailable. On iOS, if the user was signed in and the policy is set to "Disabled" they will be signed out immediately. On other platforms, they will be signed out the next time they run Google Chrome. On all platforms, their local profile data like bookmarks, passwords etc. will be preserved and still usable. The user will still be able to sign into and use Google web services like Gmail.

       If the policy is set to "Enable browser sign-in," then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser. On all platforms except iOS, the user is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user's account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Google Chrome Sync will be turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Google Chrome Sync, use the SyncDisabled policy.

       If the policy is set to "Force browser sign-in" the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to disabled. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help center article: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7572556 . This option is not supported on Linux, Android or iOS. It will fall back to "Enable browser sign-in" if used.

       If this policy is not set then the user can decide if they want to enable browser sign-in in the Google Chrome settings and use it as they see fit.

** SSLVersionMin — Minimum SSL version enabled
SYNOPSIS: "tls1.2"
 Setting the policy to a valid value means Google Chrome won't use SSL/TLS versions less than the specified version. Unrecognized values are ignored.

       If this policy is not set, then Google Chrome will show an error for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, but the user will be able to bypass it.

       If this policy is set to "tls1.2", the user will not be able to bypass this error.

       Support for setting this policy to "tls1" or "tls1.1" was removed in version 91. Suppressing the TLS 1.0/1.1 warning is no longer supported.

** SSLVersionFallbackMin (DEPRECATED) — Minimum TLS version to fallback to
SYNOPSIS: "tls1.1"
 Warning: The TLS version fallback will be removed from Google Chrome after version 52 (around September 2016) and this policy will stop working then.

       When a TLS handshake fails, Google Chrome would previously retry the connection with a lesser version of TLS in order to work around bugs in HTTPS servers. This setting configures the version at which this fallback process will stop. If a server performs version negotiation correctly (i.e. without breaking the connection) then this setting doesn't apply. Regardless, the resulting connection must still comply with SSLVersionMin.

       If this policy is not configured or if it is set to "tls1.2" then Google Chrome no longer performs this fallback. Note this does not disable support for older TLS versions, only whether Google Chrome will work around buggy servers which cannot negotiate versions correctly.

       Otherwise, if compatibility with a buggy server must be maintained, this policy may be set to "tls1.1". This is a stopgap measure and the server should be rapidly fixed.

** SSLVersionMax (DEPRECATED) — Maximum SSL version enabled
SYNOPSIS: "tls1.2"
 Warning: The max TLS version policy will be entirely removed from Google Chrome around version 75 (around June 2019).

       If this policy is not configured then Google Chrome uses the default maximum version.

       Otherwise it may be set to one of the following values: "tls1.2" or "tls1.3". When set, Google Chrome will not use SSL/TLS versions greater than the specified version. An unrecognized value will be ignored.

** CECPQ2Enabled — CECPQ2 post-quantum key-agreement enabled for TLS
SYNOPSIS: true
 If this policy is not configured, or is set to enabled, then Google Chrome will follow the default rollout process for CECPQ2, a post-quantum key-agreement algorithm in TLS.

       CECPQ2 results in larger TLS messages which, in very rare cases, can trigger bugs in some networking hardware. This policy can be set to False to disable CECPQ2 while networking issues are resolved.

       This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed in future versions of Google Chrome.

** CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForUrls — Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of URLs
SYNOPSIS: ["example.com", ".example.com"]
 Setting the policy turns off Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for the hostnames in the specified URLs. While making it harder to detect misissued certificates, hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn't be trusted (because they weren't properly publicly disclosed).

       Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren't disclosed, then Google Chrome doesn't trust those certificates.

       A URL pattern follows this format ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blocklist-filter-format ). However, because the validity of certificates for a given hostname is independent of the scheme, port, or path, Google Chrome only considers the hostname portion of the URL. Wildcard hosts aren't supported.

** CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas — Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes
SYNOPSIS: ["sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==", "sha256//////////////////////w=="]
 Setting the policy turns off enforcement of Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn't be trusted (because they weren't properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the hash must meet one of these conditions:

       * It's of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.

       * It's of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate in the certificate chain. That CA certificate is constrained through the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName has an organizationName attribute.

       * It's of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate has the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

       Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

       Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren't disclosed, then Google Chrome doesn't trust those certificates.

** CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForLegacyCas — Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities
SYNOPSIS: ["sha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==", "sha256//////////////////////w=="]
 Setting the policy turns off enforcement of Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for a list of Legacy Certificate Authorities (CA) for certificate chains with a specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hash. Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn't be trusted (because they weren't properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the subjectPublicKeyInfo hash must appear in a CA certificate recognized as a Legacy CA. A Legacy CA is publicly trusted by one or more operating systems supported by Google Chrome, but not Android Open Source Project or Google Chrome OS.

       Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

       Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren't disclosed, then Google Chrome doesn't trust those certificates.

** RC4Enabled (DEPRECATED) — Enable RC4 cipher suites in TLS
SYNOPSIS: false

** SSLErrorOverrideAllowedForOrigins — Allow proceeding from the SSL warning page on specific origins
SYNOPSIS: ["https://www.example.com", "[*.]example.edu"]
 If SSLErrorOverrideAllowed is Disabled, setting the policy lets you set a list of origin patterns that specify the sites where a user can click through warning pages Google Chrome shows when users navigate to sites that have SSL errors. Users will not be able to click through SSL warning pages on origins that are not on this list.

       If SSLErrorOverrideAllowed is Enabled or unset, this policy does nothing.

       Leaving the policy unset means SSLErrorOverrideAllowed applies for all sites.

       For detailed information on valid input patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns. * is not an accepted value for this policy. This policy only matches based on origin, so any path in the URL pattern is ignored.

** AllowedDomainsForApps — Define domains allowed to access Google Workspace
SYNOPSIS: "managedchrome.com,example.com"
 Setting the policy turns on Chrome's restricted sign-in feature in Google Workspace and prevents users from changing this setting. Users can only access Google tools using accounts from the specified domains (to allow gmail or googlemail accounts, add consumer_accounts to the list of domains). This setting prevents users from signing in and adding a Secondary Account on a managed device that requires Google authentication, if that account doesn't belong to one of the explicitly allowed domains.

       Leaving this setting empty or unset means users can access Google Workspace with any account.

       Users cannot change or override this setting.

       Note: This policy causes the X-GoogApps-Allowed-Domains header to be appended to all HTTP and HTTPS requests to all google.com domains, as described in https://support.google.com/a/answer/1668854.

** PacHttpsUrlStrippingEnabled (DEPRECATED) — Enable PAC URL stripping (for https://)
SYNOPSIS: true
 Strips privacy and security sensitive parts of https:// URLs before passing them on to PAC scripts (Proxy Auto Config) used by Google Chrome during proxy resolution.

       When True, the security feature is enabled, and https:// URLs are
       stripped before submitting them to a PAC script. In this manner the PAC
       script is not able to view data that is ordinarily protected by an
       encrypted channel (such as the URL's path and query).

       When False, the security feature is disabled, and PAC scripts are
       implicitly granted the ability to view all components of an https://
       URL. This applies to all PAC scripts regardless of origin (including
       those fetched over an insecure transport, or discovered insecurely
       through WPAD).

       This defaults to True (security feature enabled).

       It is recommended that this be set to True. The only reason to set it to
       False is if it causes a compatibility problem with existing PAC scripts.

       The policy will be removed in M75.

       Setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset means platform policy takes precedence if it conflicts with cloud policy.

       This mandatory policy affects machine scope cloud policies.

** CloudUserPolicyOverridesCloudMachinePolicy — Allow user cloud policies to override Chrome Browser Cloud Management policies.
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled allows policies associated with a Google Workspace account to take precedence if they conflict with Chrome Browser Cloud Management policies.

       Only policies originating from secure users can be merged. A secure user is affiliated with the organization that manages their browser using Chrome Browser Cloud Management. All other user-level policies will have default precedence.

       The policy can be combined with CloudPolicyOverridesPlatformPolicy. If both policies are enabled, user cloud policies will also take precedence over conflicting platform policies.

       Leaving the policy unset or setting it to disabled causes user-level cloud policies to have default priority.

** PromptForDownloadLocation — Ask where to save each file before downloading
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled means users are asked where to save each file before downloading. Setting the policy to Disabled has downloads start immediately, and users aren't asked where to save the file.

** IsolateOrigins — Enable Site Isolation for specified origins
SYNOPSIS: "https://a.example.com/,https://othersite.org/,https://[*.]corp.example.com"
 Setting the policy means each of the named origins in a comma-separated list runs in a dedicated process. Each named origin's process will only be allowed to contain documents from that origin and its subdomains. For example, specifying https://a1.example.com/ allows https://a2.a1.example.com/ in the same process, but not https://example.com or https://b.example.com.

       Since Google Chrome 77, you can also specify a range of origins to isolate using a wildcard. For example, specifying https://[*.]corp.example.com will give every origin underneath https://corp.example.com its own dedicated process, including https://corp.example.com itself, https://a1.corp.example.com, and https://a2.a1.corp.example.com.

       Note that all sites (i.e., scheme plus eTLD+1, such as https://example.com) are already isolated by default on Desktop platforms, as noted in the SitePerProcess policy. This IsolateOrigins policy is useful to isolate specific origins at a finer granularity (e.g., https://a.example.com).

       Also note that origins isolated by this policy will be unable to script other origins in the same site, which is otherwise possible if two same-site documents modify their document.domain values to match. Administrators should confirm this uncommon behavior is not used on an origin before isolating it.

       Setting the policy to off or leaving it unset lets users change this setting.

       Note: For Android, use the IsolateOriginsAndroid policy instead.

** SitePerProcess — Require Site Isolation for every site
SYNOPSIS: true
 Since Google Chrome 67, site isolation has been enabled by default on all Desktop platforms, causing every site to run in its own process. A site is a scheme plus eTLD+1 (e.g., https://example.com). Setting this policy to Enabled does not change that behavior; it only prevents users from opting out (for example, using Disable site isolation in chrome://flags). Since Google Chrome 76, setting the policy to Disabled or leaving it unset doesn't turn off site isolation, but instead allows users to opt out.

       IsolateOrigins might also be useful for isolating specific origins at a finer granularity than site (e.g., https://a.example.com).

       On Google Chrome OS version 76 and earlier, set the DeviceLoginScreenSitePerProcess device policy to the same value. (If the values don't match, a delay can occur when entering a user session.)

       Note: For Android, use the SitePerProcessAndroid policy instead.

** SharedArrayBufferUnrestrictedAccessAllowed — Specifies whether SharedArrayBuffers can be used in a non cross-origin-isolated context
SYNOPSIS: false

       Specifies whether SharedArrayBuffers can be used in a non cross-origin-isolated context. Google Chrome will require cross-origin isolation when using SharedArrayBuffers from Google Chrome 91 onward (2021-05-25) for Web Compatibility reasons. Additional details can be found on: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/enabling-shared-array-buffer/.

       When set to Enabled, sites can use SharedArrayBuffer with no restrictions.

       When set to Disabled or not set, sites can only use SharedArrayBuffers when cross-origin isolated.

** SandboxExternalProtocolBlocked — Allow Chrome to block navigations toward external protocols in sandboxed iframes
SYNOPSIS: true
 Chrome will block navigations toward external protocols inside
       sandboxed iframe. See https://chromestatus.com/features/5680742077038592.

       When True, this lets Chrome blocks those navigations.

       When False, this prevents Chrome from blocking those navigations.

       This defaults to True: security feature enabled.

       This can be used by administrators who need more time to update their internal website affected by this new restriction. This Enterprise policy is temporary; it's intended to be removed after Google Chrome version 104.

** CrossOriginWebAssemblyModuleSharingEnabled — Specifies whether WebAssembly modules can be sent cross-origin
SYNOPSIS: true

       Specifies whether WebAssembly modules can be sent to another window or worker cross-origin. Cross-origin WebAssembly module sharing will be deprecated as part of the efforts to deprecate document.domain, see https://github.com/mikewest/deprecating-document-domain. This policy allows to re-enable cross-origin WebAssembly module sharing to offer a longer transition period in the deprecation process.

       When set to True, sites can send WebAssembly modules also cross-origin without restrictions.

       When set to False or not set, sites can only send WebAssembly modules to windows and workers in the same origin.

** DisplayCapturePermissionsPolicyEnabled — Specifies whether the display-capture permissions-policy is checked or skipped.
SYNOPSIS: true

       The display-capture permissions-policy gates access to getDisplayMedia(), as per this spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#feature-policy-integration. However, if this policy is Disabled, this requirement is not enforced, and getDisplayMedia() is allowed from contexts that would otherwise be forbidden. This Enterprise policy is temporary; it's intended to be removed after Google Chrome version 100. It is intended to unblock Enterprise users whose application is non-spec compliant, but needs time to be fixed.

       When enabled or not set, sites can only call getDisplayMedia() from contexts which are allowlisted by the display-capture permissions-policy.

       When disabled, sites can call getDisplayMedia() even from contexts which are not allowlisted by the display-capture permissions policy. Note that other restrictions may still apply.

** WebDriverOverridesIncompatiblePolicies (DEPRECATED) — Allow WebDriver to Override Incompatible Policies
SYNOPSIS: true

       This policy was removed in M80, because it is not necessary anymore as
       WebDriver is now compatible with all existing policies.

       This policy allows users of the WebDriver feature to override policies which can interfere with its operation.

       Currently this policy disables SitePerProcess and IsolateOrigins policies.

       If the policy is enabled, WebDriver will be able to override incomaptible policies.

       If the policy is disabled or not configured, WebDriver will not be allowed to override incompatible policies.

** UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure (DEPRECATED) — Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on insecure origins should not apply
SYNOPSIS: ["http://testserver.example.com/", "*.example.org"]
 Deprecated in M69. Use
       OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin instead.

       The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such as "*.example.com") for which security restrictions on insecure origins will not apply.

       The intent is to allow organizations to allow origins for legacy applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for internal web development so that their developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labeled "Not Secure" in the omnibox.

       Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will override the command-line flag.

       This policy is deprecated in M69 in favor of OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin. If both policies are present, OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin will override this policy.

       For more information on secure contexts, see https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/

** SpellcheckEnabled — Enable spellcheck
SYNOPSIS: false
 Setting the policy to Enabled turns spellcheck on, and users can't turn it off. On Microsoft® Windows®, Google Chrome OS and Linux®, spellcheck languages can be switched on or off individually, so users can still turn spellcheck off by switching off every spellcheck language. To avoid that, use the SpellcheckLanguage to force-enable specific spellcheck languages.

       Setting the policy to Disabled turns off spellcheck from all sources, and users can't turn it on. The SpellCheckServiceEnabled, SpellcheckLanguage and SpellcheckLanguageBlocklist policies have no effect when this policy is set to False.

       Leaving the policy unset lets users turn spellcheck on or off in the language settings.

** RelaunchNotification — Notify a user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required
SYNOPSIS: 1
 Notify users that Google Chrome must be relaunched or Google Chrome OS must be restarted to apply a pending update.

       This policy setting enables notifications to inform the user that a browser relaunch or device restart is recommended or required. If not set, Google Chrome indicates to the user that a relaunch is needed via subtle changes to its menu, while Google Chrome OS indicates such via a notification in the system tray. If set to 'Recommended', a recurring warning will be shown to the user that a relaunch is recommended. The user can dismiss this warning to defer the relaunch. If set to 'Required', a recurring warning will be shown to the user indicating that a browser relaunch will be forced once the notification period passes. The default period is seven days for Google Chrome and four days for Google Chrome OS, and may be configured via the RelaunchNotificationPeriod policy setting.

       The user's session is restored following the relaunch/restart.

** RelaunchNotificationPeriod — Set the time period for update notifications
SYNOPSIS: 604800000
 Allows you to set the time period, in milliseconds, over which users are notified that Google Chrome must be relaunched or that a Google Chrome OS device must be restarted to apply a pending update.

       Over this time period, the user will be repeatedly informed of the need for an update. For Google Chrome OS devices, a restart notification appears in the system tray according to the RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod policy. For Google Chrome browsers, the app menu changes to indicate that a relaunch is needed once one third of the notification period passes. This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the RelaunchNotification policy follow this same schedule.

       If not set, the default period of 604800000 milliseconds (one week) is used.

** RelaunchWindow — Set the time interval for relaunch
SYNOPSIS: {"entries": [{"start": {"hour": 2, "minute": 15}, "duration_mins": 240}]}
 Specify a target time window for the end of the relaunch notification period.

       Users are notified of the need for a browser relaunch or device restart based on the RelaunchNotification and RelaunchNotificationPeriod policy settings. Browsers and devices are forcibly restarted at the end of the notification period when the RelaunchNotification policy is set to 'Required'. This RelaunchWindow policy can be used to defer the end of the notification period so that it falls within a specific time window.

       If this policy is not set, the default target time window for Google Chrome OS is between 2 AM and 4 AM. The default target time window for Google Chrome is the whole day (i.e., the end of the notification period is never deferred).

       Note: Though the policy can accept multiple items in entries, all but the first item are ignored.

SYNOPSIS: ["https://www.example.com", "[*.]example.edu"]
 This policy is deprecated, please use the 'AutoplayAllowlist' policy instead.

       Setting the policy lets videos play automatically (without user consent) with audio content in Google Chrome. If AutoplayAllowed policy is set to True, then this policy has no effect. If AutoplayAllowed is set to False, then any URL patterns set in this policy can still play. If this policy changes while Google Chrome is running, it only applies to newly opened tabs.

       For detailed information on valid url patterns, please see https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.

       Setting the policy to False prevents Google Chrome from showing product information as full-tab content.

       Setting the policy controls the presentation of the welcome pages that help users sign in to Google Chrome, set Google Chrome as users' default browser, or otherwise inform them of product features.

** OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin — Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on insecure origins should not apply
SYNOPSIS: ["http://testserver.example.com/", "*.example.org"]
 Setting the policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such as *.example.com) for which security restrictions on insecure origins won't apply. Organizations can specify origins for legacy applications that can't deploy TLS or set up a staging server for internal web development, so developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled "Not Secure" in the address bar.

       Setting a list of URLs in this policy amounts to setting the command-line flag --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. The policy overrides the command-line flag and UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

       For more information on secure contexts, see Secure Contexts ( https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts ).

** TabFreezingEnabled (DEPRECATED) — Allow background tabs freeze
SYNOPSIS: false
 Controls whether Google Chrome can freeze tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes.

       If the policy is set to true, tabs that have been in the background for at least 5 minutes may be frozen. Tab freezing reduces CPU, battery and memory usage. Google Chrome uses heuristics to avoid freezing tabs that do useful work in the background (e.g. display notifications, play sound, stream video). Web developers can also opt-out their site from freezing (https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/chrome/browser/performance_manager/docs/freezing_opt_out_opt_in.md).

       If the policy is set to false, no tabs will be frozen.

** UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled — Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled means URL-keyed anonymized data collection, which sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to make searches and browsing better, is always active.

       Setting the policy to Disabled results in no URL-keyed anonymized data collection.

       If you set the policy, users can't change. If not set, then URL-keyed anonymized data collection at first, but users can change it.

** WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed — Allow collection of WebRTC event logs from Google services
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to Enabled means Google Chrome can collect WebRTC event logs from Google services such as Hangouts Meet and upload them to Google. These logs have diagnostic information for debugging issues with audio or video meetings in Google Chrome, such as the time and size of RTP packets, feedback about congestion on the network, and metadata about time and quality of audio and video frames. These logs have no audio or video content from the meeting. To make debugging easier, Google might associate these logs, by means of a session ID, with other logs collected by the Google service itself.

       Setting the policy to Disabled results in no collection or uploading of such logs.

       Leaving the policy unset on versions up to and including M76 means Google Chrome defaults to not being able to collect and upload these logs. Starting at M77, Google Chrome defaults to being able to collect and upload these logs from most profiles affected by cloud-based, user-level enterprise policies. From M77 up to and including M80, Google Chrome can also collect and upload these logs by default from profiles affected by Google Chrome on-premise management.

** CoalesceH2ConnectionsWithClientCertificatesForHosts — Allow coalescing of HTTP/2 connections for these hosts even when client certificates are used
SYNOPSIS: ["example.com"]
 This policy allows HTTP/2 connection coalescing when client certificates are in use. In order to coalesce, both the hostname of the potential new connection and the hostname of an existing connection must match one or more patterns described by this policy. The policy is a list of hosts using the URLBlocklist filter format: "example.com" matches "example.com" and all subdomains (e.g. "sub.example.com"), while ".example.net" matches exactly "example.net".

       Coalescing requests to different hosts over connections that use client certificates can create security and privacy issues, as the ambient authority will be conveyed to all requests, even if the user did not explicitly authorize this. This policy is temporary and will be removed in a future release. See https://crbug.com/855690.

       If this policy is left unset, then the default behavior of not allowing any HTTP/2 connection coalescing on connections using client certificates will be used.

 Setting the policy defines the return value of Managed Configuration API for given origin.

       Managed configuration API is a key-value configuration that can be accessed via navigator.managed.getManagedConfiguration() javascript call. This API is only available to origins which correspond to force-installed web applications via WebAppInstallForceList.

 Setting the policy specifies a list of web apps that install silently, without user interaction, and which users can't uninstall or turn off.

       Each list item of the policy is an object with a mandatory member:
       url (the URL of the web app to install)

       and 5 optional members:
       - default_launch_container
       (for how the web app opens—a new tab is the default)

       - create_desktop_shortcut
       (True if you want to create Linux and
       Microsoft® Windows® desktop shortcuts).

       - fallback_app_name
       (Starting with Google Chrome version 90,
       allows you to override the app name if it is not a
       Progressive Web App (PWA), or the app name that is temporarily
       installed if it is a PWA but authentication is required before the
       installation can be completed. If both
       custom_name and
       fallback_app_name are provided,
       the latter will be ignored.)

       - custom_name
       (Starting with Google Chrome
       version 96, allows you to permanently override the app name for all web
       apps and PWAs. Currently only supported on
       Google Chrome OS.)

       - custom_icon
       (Starting with Google Chrome
       version 96, allows you to override the app icon of installed apps. The
       icons have to be square, maximal 1 MB in size, and in one of the following
       formats: jpeg, png, gif, webp, ico. The hash value has to be the SHA256
       hash of the icon file. Currently only supported on
       Google Chrome OS.)

** ContextAwareAccessSignalsAllowlist — Enable attestation flow for a list of URLs
SYNOPSIS: ["https://example1.com", "https://[*.]example2.com", "https://foo.example3.com/path"]
 Enable Chrome Enterprise Platform Identity Connector for a list of URLs.

       Setting this policy specifies which URLs should be allowed to be part of the attestation flow to get the set of signals from the machine.

       Leaving this policy unset or empty means that no endpoint will be able to start the attestation flow nor get signals from the machine.

       URLs must have HTTPS scheme, e.g. "https://example.com".

       Note: Wildcards, *, are allowed.

       For ChromeOS, this policy is related to remote attestation where a certificate is automatically generated and uploaded to the Device Management Server.

 List of Chrome Enterprise Connectors services settings to be applied to the OnFileDownloaded Enterprise Connector, which triggers when a file is downloaded in Chrome.

       The url_list, tags, enable and disable fields are used to determine if the connector should send a file for analysis when it is downloaded from a specific page and what tags to include in the analysis request for that file. A tag corresponding to an 'enable' pattern will be included in the analysis request if the page URL matches a pattern associated to that tag as long as no 'disable' pattern with that same tag matches the page URL. The analysis occurs if at least 1 tag is to be included in the request.

       The service_provider field identifies which analysis service provider the settings correspond to.

       The block_until_verdict field being set to 1 means Chrome will wait to get a response from the analysis service before giving the user access to the downloaded file. Any other integer value means Chrome gives the user access to the file immediately.

       The block_password_protected field controls whether Chrome blocks or allows files that are password protected.

       The block_large_files fields controls whether Chrome blocks or allows files that are too large to be analyzed (50+ MB).

       The require_justification_tags field is used to determine for which tags the connector should require the user to enter a justification to bypass a scan that results in a bypassable warning. If the field is not set, it's assumed that a justification is not required.

       The custom_messages, message, learn_more_url, language and tag fields are used to configure a message to show the user when a warning is shown after a scan had a non-clean verdict. The message field contains the text to show the user and should have at most 200 characters. The learn_more_url field contains an admin-provided URL that will be clickable by the user to get more customer-provided information about why the action was blocked. The language field is optional and contains the language of the message. An empty language field or a value of 'default' indicates a message to be used when the user's language doesn't have a message. The tag field specifies for which type of scans the message is displayed. The custom_messages list can have zero or more entries, where each entry is required to have non-empty message and tag fields.

       This policy can only be set from the Google Admin console.

       The require_justification_tags field is used to determine for which tags the connector should require the user to enter a justification to bypass a scan that results in a bypassable warning. If the field is not set, it's assumed that a justification is not required.

       The custom_messages, message, learn_more_url, language and tag fields are used to configure a message to show the user when a warning is shown after a scan had a non-clean verdict. The message field contains the text to show the user and should have at most 200 characters. The learn_more_url field contains an admin-provided URL that will be clickable by the user to get more customer-provided information about why the action was blocked. The language field is optional and contains the language of the message. An empty language field or a value of 'default' indicates a message to be used when the user's language doesn't have a message. The tag field specifies for which type of scans the message is displayed. The custom_messages list can have zero or more entries, where each entry is required to have non-empty message and tag fields.

       This policy can only be set from the Google Admin console.

** OnBulkDataEntryEnterpriseConnector — Configuration policy for the OnBulkDataEntry Chrome Enterprise Connector
SYNOPSIS: [{"service_provider": "Google", "enable": [{"url_list": ["*"], "tags": ["malware"]}, {"url_list": ["*.them.com", "*.others.com"], "tags": ["dlp"]}], "disable": [{"url_list": ["*.us.com"], "tags": ["malware"]}], "block_until_verdict": 0, "minimum_data_size": 100, "require_justification_tags": ["malware", "dlp"], "custom_messages": [{"message": "Custom message for potential sensitive data leaks.", "learn_more_url": "moreinfo.example.com", "language": "default", "tag": "dlp"}, {"message": "Custom message for potential malware file transfer.", "learn_more_url": "moreinfo.example.com/en", "language": "en-US", "tag": "malware"}, {"message": "Message pour le transfert de logiciel malveillant.", "learn_more_url": "moreinfo.example.com/fr", "language": "fr-CA", "tag": "malware"}]}]
 List of Chrome Enterprise Connectors services settings to be applied to the OnBulkDataEntry Enterprise Connector, which triggers when data is entered in Chrome from the clipboard or by drag and dropping web content.

       The url_list, tags, enable and disable fields are used to determine if the connector should send data for analysis when it is entered in a specific page and what tags to include in the analysis request for that data. A tag corresponding to an 'enable' pattern will be included in the analysis request if the page URL matches a pattern associated to that tag as long as no 'disable' pattern with that same tag matches the page URL. The analysis occurs if at least 1 tag is to be included in the request.

       The service_provider field identifies which analysis service provider the settings correspond to.

       The block_until_verdict field being set to 1 means Chrome will wait to get a response from the analysis service before giving the page access to the data. Any other integer value means Chrome gives the page access to the data immediately.

       The minimum_data_size field indicates the minimum size (in bytes) data entered in Chrome must equal or surpass to be scanned. The default value is 100 bytes if the field is unset.

       The require_justification_tags field is used to determine for which tags the connector should require the user to enter a justification to bypass a scan that results in a bypassable warning. If the field is not set, it's assumed that a justification is not required.

       The custom_messages, message, learn_more_url, language and tag fields are used to configure a message to show the user when a warning is shown after a scan had a non-clean verdict. The message field contains the text to show the user and should have at most 200 characters. The learn_more_url field contains an admin-provided URL that will be clickable by the user to get more customer-provided information about why the action was blocked. The language field is optional and contains the language of the message. An empty language field or a value of 'default' indicates a message to be used when the user's language doesn't have a message. The tag field specifies for which type of scans the message is displayed. The custom_messages list can have zero or more entries, where each entry is required to have non-empty message and tag fields.

       This policy can only be set from the Google Admin console.

** OnSecurityEventEnterpriseConnector — Configuration policy for the OnSecurityEvent Chrome Enterprise Connector
SYNOPSIS: [{"service_provider": "Google", "enabled_event_names": ["passwordChangedEvent", "sensitiveDataEvent"]}]
 List of Chrome Enterprise Connectors services settings to be applied to the OnSecurityEvent Enterprise Connector, which triggers when a security event occurs in Chrome. This includes negative verdicts from analysis Enterprise Connectors, password reuse, navigations to unsafe pages and other security sensitive user actions.

       The service_provider field identifies which reporting service provider the settings correspond to and the enabled_event_names field identifies which events are enabled for this provider.

** EnterpriseRealTimeUrlCheckMode — Check Safe Browsing status of URLs in real time
SYNOPSIS: 1
 This policy controls checking URLs in real time to identify unsafe URLs.

       If this policy is left not set or set to ‘Disabled’, the consumer Safe Browsing checks will be applied. Consumer Safe Browsing checks can still include real time lookups, depending on the value of the “Make searches and browsing better” setting and the value of the UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled policy.

       If this policy is set to ‘Enabled’, URLs will be sent to be scanned in real time under enterprise ToS. It will result in Chrome sending URLs to Google Cloud or third parties of your choosing to check them in real time. The consumer version of Safe Browsing real time lookup will be switched off.

       This policy can only be set from the Google Admin console.

** HSTSPolicyBypassList — List of names that will bypass the HSTS policy check
SYNOPSIS: ["meet"]
 Setting the policy specifies a list of hostnames that bypass preloaded HSTS upgrades from http to https.

       Only single-label hostnames are allowed in this policy, and this policy only applies to "static" HSTS-preloaded entries (for instance, "app", "new", "search", "play"). This policy does not prevent HSTS upgrades for servers that have "dynamically" requested HSTS upgrades using a Strict-Transport-Security response header.

       Supplied hostnames must be canonicalized: Any IDNs must be converted to their A-label format, and all ASCII letters must be lowercase. This policy only applies to the specific single-label hostnames specified, not to subdomains of those names.

** AllowSyncXHRInPageDismissal — Allows a page to perform synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.
SYNOPSIS: false
 This policy allows an admin to specify that a page may send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

       When the policy is set to enabled, pages are allowed to send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

       When the policy is set to disabled or not set, pages are not allowed to send synchronous XHR requests during page dismissal.

       This policy will be removed in Chrome 93.

** TLS13HardeningForLocalAnchorsEnabled (DEPRECATED) — Enable a TLS 1.3 security feature for local trust anchors.
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy controls a security feature in TLS 1.3 which protects connections against downgrade attacks. It is backwards-compatible and will not affect connections to compliant TLS 1.2 servers or proxies. However, older versions of some TLS-intercepting proxies have an implementation flaw which causes them to be incompatible.

       If this policy is set to True or not set, Google Chrome will enable these security protections for all connections.

       If this policy is set to False, Google Chrome will disable these security protections for connections authenticated with locally-installed CA certificates. These protections are always enabled for connections authenticated with publicly-trusted CA certificates.

       The default value for this policy was changed in Google Chrome 81 from false to true. Affected proxies are expected to fail connections with an error code of ERR_TLS13_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED. Administrators who need more time to upgrade affected proxies may use this policy to temporarily disable this security feature. This policy was removed in version 86.

** AudioSandboxEnabled — Allow the audio sandbox to run
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy controls the audio process sandbox.
       If this policy is enabled, the audio process will run sandboxed.
       If this policy is disabled, the audio process will run unsandboxed and the WebRTC audio-processing module will run in the renderer process.
       This leaves users open to security risks related to running the audio subsystem unsandboxed.
       If this policy is not set, the default configuration for the audio sandbox will be used, which may differ per platform.
       This policy is intended to give enterprises flexibility to disable the audio sandbox if they use security software setups that interfere with the sandbox.

** CorsMitigationList (DEPRECATED) — Enable CORS check mitigations in the new CORS implementation
SYNOPSIS: ["x-googapps-allowed-domains", "youtube-restrict"]
 Enable CORS check mitigations in the new CORS implementation, allowing Extensions to keep compatible behavior, and allowing Google Chrome to send specified headers without CORS checks.

       If this list is set to empty, Google Chrome tries to run Extensions in compatible manners, and does not introduce API changes for Google Chrome 79 as explained at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest.

       If this list is set to have HTTP request header names, CORS inspection will ignore the listed headers in addition to enable the mitigation for Extensions.

       If this list is not set, both mitigations explained above are not applied.

       For details on CORS, visit: https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5768642492891136.

** CorsLegacyModeEnabled (DEPRECATED) — Use the legacy CORS implementation rather than new CORS
SYNOPSIS: false
 Use the legacy CORS implementation rather than new CORS.

       If this setting is set to True, the legacy implementation is used that should be compatible with previous versions.

       If this setting is set to False, or is not set, the new implementation is used that might cause enterprise specific compatibility issues potentially.

       This policy will be removed after a couple of milestones.

       For details on CORS, visit: https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5768642492891136.

       If this policy is set to True, the Web Components v0 features will be enabled for all sites.

       If this policy is set to False or not set, the Web Components v0 features will be disabled by default, starting in M80.

       If this policy is set to True, the "legacy" form control elements will be used for all sites.

       If this policy is set to False or not set, the form control elements will be enabled as they are launched in M81, M82, and M83.

       If this policy is set to enabled, the capability of sending phone numbers to Android devices will be enabled for the Chrome user.

       If this policy is set to disabled, the capability of sending phone numbers to Android devices will be disabled for the Chrome user.

       If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

** UserDataSnapshotRetentionLimit — Limits the number of user data snapshots retained for use in case of emergency rollback.
SYNOPSIS: 3
 Following each major version update, Chrome will create a snapshot of certain portions of the user's browsing data for use in case of a later emergency version rollback. If an emergency rollback is performed to a version for which a user has a corresponding snapshot, the data in the snapshot is restored. This allows users to retain such settings as bookmarks and autofill data.

       If this policy is not set, the default value of 3 is used

       If the policy is set, old snapshots are deleted as needed to respect the limit. If the policy is set to 0, no snapshots will be taken

** AmbientAuthenticationInPrivateModesEnabled — Enable Ambient Authentication for profile types.
SYNOPSIS: 0
 Configuring this policy will allow/disallow ambient authentication for Incognito and Guest profiles in Google Chrome.

       Ambient Authentication is http authentication with default credentials if explicit credentials are not provided via NTLM/Kerberos/Negotiate challenge/response schemes.

       Setting the RegularOnly (value 0), allows ambient authentication for Regular sessions only. Incognito and Guest sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

       Setting the IncognitoAndRegular (value 1), allows ambient authentication for Incognito and Regular sessions. Guest sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

       Setting the GuestAndRegular (value 2), allows ambient authentication for Guest and Regular sessions. Incognito sessions wouldn't be allowed to ambiently authenticate.

       Setting the  All (value 3), allows ambient authentication for all sessions.

       Note that, ambient authentication is always allowed on regular profiles.

       In Google Chrome version 81 and later, if the policy is left not set, ambient authentication will be enabled in regular sessions only.

SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy has been removed as of M85, please use InsecureContentAllowedForUrls to allow insecure content on a per-site basis instead.
        This policy controls the treatment for mixed content (HTTP content in HTTPS sites) in the browser.
        If the policy is set to true or unset, audio and video mixed content will be autoupgraded to HTTPS (i.e. the URL will be rewritten as HTTPS, without a fallback if the resource is not available over HTTPS) and a 'Not Secure' warning will be shown in the URL bar for image mixed content.
        If the policy is set to false, autoupgrades will be disabled for audio and video, and no warning will be shown for images.
        This policy does not affect other types of mixed content other than audio, video, and images.

** AccessibilityImageLabelsEnabled — Enable Get Image Descriptions from Google.
SYNOPSIS: false
 The Get Image Descriptions from Google
           accessibility feature enables visually-impaired screen reader users to
           get descriptions of unlabeled images on the web. Users who choose to enable it
           will have the option of using an anonymous Google service to provide
           automatic descriptions for unlabeled images they encounter on the web.

           If this feature is enabled, the content of images will be sent to Google
           servers in order to generate a description. No cookies or other user
           data is sent, and Google does not save or log any image content.

           If this policy is set to Enabled, the
           Get Image Descriptions from Google
           feature will be enabled, though it will only affect users who are using a
           screen reader or other similar assistive technology.

           If this policy is set to Disabled, users will not have the option of enabling
           the feature.

           If this policy is not set, user can choose to use this feature or not.

** IntensiveWakeUpThrottlingEnabled — Control the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature.
SYNOPSIS: true
 When enabled the IntensiveWakeUpThrottling feature causes Javascript timers in background tabs to be aggressively throttled and coalesced, running no more than once per minute after a page has been backgrounded for 5 minutes or more.

           This is a web standards compliant feature, but it may break functionality
           on some websites by causing certain actions to be delayed by up to a
           minute. However, it results in significant CPU and battery savings when
           enabled. See https://bit.ly/30b1XR4 for more details.

           If this policy is set to enabled then the feature will be force enabled, and
           users will not be able to override this.

           If this policy is set to disabled then the feature will be force disabled, and
           users will not be able to override this.

           If this policy is left unset then the feature will be controlled by its
           own internal logic, which can be manually configured by users.

           Note that the policy is applied per renderer process, with the most recent
           value of the policy setting in force when a renderer process starts. A full
           restart is required to ensure that all loaded tabs receive a consistent
           policy setting. It is harmless for processes to be running with different
           values of this policy.

** UserAgentClientHintsEnabled (DEPRECATED) — Control the User-Agent Client Hints feature.
SYNOPSIS: true
 Note that this policy was removed in M94.  This policy was intended for short-term adaptation purposes only.

       When enabled the User-Agent Client Hints feature sends granular request headers providing information about the user browser and environment.
       This is an additive feature, but the new headers may break some websites that restrict the characters that requests may contain.
       If this policy is enabled or not set the User-Agent Client Hints feature is enabled. If the policy is disabled the feature is unavailable.

       If this policy is set to False, then the default URL display will apply.

** InsecureFormsWarningsEnabled — Enable warnings for insecure forms
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy controls the treatment for insecure forms (forms that submit over HTTP) embedded in secure (HTTPS) sites in the browser.
        If the policy is enabled or unset, a full page warning will be shown when an insecure form is submitted. Additionally, a warning bubble will be shown next to the form fields when they are focused, and autofill will be disabled for those forms.
        If the policy is disabled, warnings will not be shown for insecure forms, and autofill will work normally.

** LookalikeWarningAllowlistDomains — Suppress lookalike domain warnings on domains
SYNOPSIS: ["foo.example.com", "example.org"]
 This policy prevents the display of lookalike URL warnings on the sites listed. These warnings are typically shown on sites that Google Chrome believes might be trying to spoof another site the user is familiar with.

        If the policy is enabled and set to one or more domains, no lookalike warnings pages will be shown when the user visits pages on that domain.

        If the policy is not set, or set to an empty list, warnings may appear on any site the user visits.

        A hostname can be allowed with a complete host match, or any domain match. For example, a URL like "https://foo.example.com/bar" may have warnings suppressed if this list includes either "foo.example.com" or "example.com".

       When this policy is disabled or not set, these TLS/DTLS versions are

SYNOPSIS: [{"time_to_live_in_hours": 24, "data_types": ["browsing_history"]}, {"time_to_live_in_hours": 12, "data_types": ["password_signin", "autofill"]}]
 Configures browsing data lifetime settings for Google Chrome. This policy allows admins to configure (per data-type) when data is deleted by the browser. This is useful for customers that work with sensitive customer data. The policy will only take effect if SyncDisabled is set to true.

       The available data types are 'browsing_history', 'download_history', 'cookies_and_other_site_data', 'cached_images_and_files', 'password_signin', 'autofill', 'site_settings' and 'hosted_app_data'.

       The browser will automatically remove data of selected types that is older than 'time_to_live_in_hours'. The minimum value that can be set is 1 hour.

       The deletion of expired data will happen 15 seconds after the browser starts then every hour while the browser is running.

** LacrosSecondaryProfilesAllowed — Allow users to create and use secondary profiles, and use guest mode in the Lacros browser
SYNOPSIS: true
 This setting allows users to create and use secondary profiles, and use guest mode in the Lacros browser.

       Similar to both BrowserAddPersonEnabled and BrowserGuestModeEnabled, if this policy is set to false or unset, the user cannot create or use secondary profiles, and use guest mode. Previously created secondary profiles, if any, will be unavailable.

       If this policy is set to true, the user can create and use secondary profiles, and use guest mode.

       Note, that if this policy is set to true but BrowserAddPersonEnabled is set to false, the user cannot create secondary profiles. The same for BrowserGuestModeEnabled and guest mode.

SYNOPSIS: ["browsing_history", "download_history", "cookies_and_other_site_data", "cached_images_and_files", "password_signin", "autofill", "site_settings", "hosted_app_data"]
 Configures a list of browsing data types that should be deleted when the user closes all browser windows. The available data types are browsing history (browsing_history), download history (download_history), cookies (cookies_and_other_site_data), cache(cached_images_and_files), autofill (autofill), passwords (password_signin), site settings (site_settings) and hosted apps data (hosted_app_data). This policy does not take precedence over AllowDeletingBrowserHistory.

       This policy requires the SyncDisabled policy to be set to true, otherwise it will be ignored. If this policy is set at platform level, Sync should be disabled at platform level. If this policy is set at user level, Sync should be disabled for that user in order for this policy to take effect.

       If Google Chrome does not exit cleanly (for example, if the browser or the OS crashes), the browsing data will be cleared the next time the profile is loaded.

 List of settings to be applied to the File System Enterprise Connector, which triggers when a file is downloaded.

       The url_list, mime_types, enable and disable fields are used to determine if the connector should send a file to the service provider when downloading from a web page. The web page URL must match a pattern associated to an 'enable' pattern and not associated to a 'disable' pattern.  The file's MIME type must also match a pattern associated to an 'enable' pattern and not associated to a 'disable' pattern.

       The service_provider field identifies which analysis service provider the settings correspond to.

       The enterprise_id field is a unique ID for a partner service provider that identifies the customer's account with the service provider. When the user is asked to sign in as part of setting up the File System Enterprise Connector, only user accounts associated with this customer's service provider account are permitted.

       This policy can only be set from the Google Admin console.

 Setting the policy controls web app management settings for Google Chrome.

       This policy allows an admin to specify settings for web apps installed through WebAppInstallForceList. A default configuration can be set using the special ID "*", which applies to all web apps without a custom configuration in this policy.

       The "run_on_os_login" field specifies if a web app can be run during OS login. If this field is set to "blocked", the web app will not run during OS login and the user will not be able to enable this later. If this field is set to "run_windowed", the web app will run during OS login and the user will not be able to disable this later. If this field is set to "allowed", the user will be able to configure the web app to run at OS login. The default configuration only allows the "allowed" and "blocked" values.

 As described in https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5148698084376576 , JavaScript modal dialogs, triggered by window.alert, window.confirm, and window.prompt, will be blocked in Google Chrome if triggered from a subframe whose origin is different from the main frame origin.
        This policy allows overriding that change.
        If the policy is set to enabled or unset, JavaScript dialogs triggered from a different origin subframe will be blocked.
        If the policy is set to disabled, JavaScript dialogs triggered from a different origin subframe will not be blocked.

        This policy will be removed in Google Chrome version 95.

** ForcedLanguages — Configure the content and order of preferred languages
SYNOPSIS: ["en-US"]
 This policy allows admins to configure the order of the preferred languages in Google Chrome's settings.

       The order of the list will appear in the same order under the "Order languages based on your preference" section in chrome://settings/languages. Users won't be able to remove or reorder languages set by the policy, but will be able to add languages underneath those set by the policy. Users will also have full control over the browser's UI language and translation/spell check settings, unless enforced by other policies.

       Leaving the policy unset lets users manipulate the entire list of preferred languages.

** BrowserThemeColor — Configure the color of the browser's theme
SYNOPSIS: "#FFFFFF"
 This policy allows admins to configure the color of Google Chrome's theme. The input string should be a valid hex color string matching the format "#RRGGBB".

       Setting the policy to a valid hex color causes a theme based on that color to be automatically generated and applied to the browser. Users won't be able to change the theme set by the policy.

       Leaving the policy unset lets users change their browser's theme as preferred.

** WebRtcIPHandling — The IP handling policy of WebRTC
SYNOPSIS: "default"
 This policy allows restricting which IP addresses and interfaces WebRTC uses when attempting to find the best available connection. See RFC 8828 section 5.2 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8828.html#section-5.2). When unset, defaults to using all available interfaces.

** ExplicitlyAllowedNetworkPorts — Explicitly allowed network ports
SYNOPSIS: ["10080"]
 There is a list of restricted ports built into Google Chrome. Connections to these ports will fail. This setting permits bypassing that list. The value is a comma-separated list of zero or more ports that outgoing connections will be permitted on.

       Ports are restricted to prevent Google Chrome being used as a vector to exploit various network vulnerabilities. Setting this policy may expose your network to attacks. This policy is intended as a temporary workaround for errors with code "ERR_UNSAFE_PORT" while migrating a service running on a blocked port to a standard port (ie. port 80 or 443).

       Malicious websites can easily detect that this policy is set, and for what ports, and use that information to target attacks.

       Each port here is labelled with a date that it can be unblocked until. After that date the port will be restricted regardless of this setting.

       Leaving the value empty or unset means that all restricted ports will be blocked. If there is a mixture of valid and invalid values, the valid ones will be applied.

       This policy overrides the "--explicitly-allowed-ports" command-line option.

** TripleDESEnabled (DEPRECATED) — Enable 3DES cipher suites in TLS
SYNOPSIS: false
 Warning: 3DES will be completely removed from Google Chrome in version 95 (around October 2021) and this policy will stop working then.

       If the policy is set to true, then 3DES cipher suites in TLS will be enabled. If it is set to false, they will be disabled. If the policy is unset, 3DES cipher suites are disabled by default. This policy may be used to temporarily retain compatibility with an outdated server. This is a stopgap measure and the server should be reconfigured.

** ManagedAccountsSigninRestriction — Add restrictions on managed accounts
SYNOPSIS: "primary_account"

       This policy requires SigninInterceptionEnabled to be set to True to take effect.

       If this policy is set to 'primary_account' at the machine level, all managed accounts will be forced to be primary.
       If this policy is set to 'primary_account' on an account, that account will always be a primary account, but may have secondary accounts in its profile.

       If this policy is set to 'primary_account_strict' at the machine level, all managed accounts will be forced to be primary.
       If this policy is set to 'primary_account_strict' on an account, that account will always be a primary account and will not have any secondary accounts in its profile.

       If this policy is set to 'none' or not set, managed accounts have no restrictions. This may result in a managed account being a secondary account, which disables its ability to receive policies set on the account by the admin.

** LockIconInAddressBarEnabled — Enable lock icon in the omnibox for secure connections
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy controls the treatment for lock icon in the omnibox.
        From Chrome M93, there is a new omnibox icon for secure connections.
        If the policy is Enabled, Chrome will use the existing lock icon for secure connections.

** DesktopSharingHubEnabled — Enable desktop sharing in the omnibox and 3-dot menu
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting the policy to True or leaving it unset lets users share or save the current webpage using actions provided by the desktop sharing hub. The sharing hub is accessed through either an omnibox icon or the 3-dot menu.

        Setting the policy to False removes the sharing icon from the omnibox and the entry from the 3-dot menu.

 Chrome Apps are deprecated on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
       If this policy is enabled, Google Chrome will continue to allow Chrome Apps to be run on these platforms until the final date when Chrome Apps support is removed on all platforms, June 2022.
       If this policy is disabled or unset, Chrome Apps may not be allowed to run, depending on the status of the deprecation rollout.
       In either case, Chrome Apps that are force installed by policy will continue to be allowed.

** AccessCodeCastEnabled — Allow users to select cast devices with an access code or QR code from within the Google Cast menu.
SYNOPSIS: true
 This policy controls whether a user will be presented with an option, within the Google Cast menu which allows them to cast to cast devices that do not appear in the Google Cast menu, using either the access code or QR code displayed on the cast devices's screen.
       By default, a user must reenter the access code or rescan the QR code in order to initiate a subsequent casting session, but if the AccessCodeCastDeviceDuration policy has been set to a non-zero value (the default is zero), then the cast device will remain in the list of available cast devices until the specified period of time has expired.
       When this policy is set to Enabled, users will be presented with the option to select cast devices by using an access code or by scanning a QR code.
       When this policy is set to Disabled or not set, users will not be given the option to select cast devices by using an access code or by scanning a QR code.

** AccessCodeCastDeviceDuration — Specifies how long (in seconds) a cast device selected with an access code or QR code stays in the Google Cast menu's list of cast devices.
SYNOPSIS: 60
 This policy specifies how long (in seconds) a cast device that was previously selected via an access code or QR code can be seen within the Google Cast menu of cast devices.
       The lifetime of an entry starts at the time the access code was first entered or the QR code was first scanned.
       During this period the cast device will appear in the Google Cast menu's list of cast devices.
       After this period, in order to use the cast device again the access code must be reentered or the QR code must be rescanned.
       By default, the period is zero seconds, so cast devices will not stay in the Google Cast menu, and so the access code must be reentered, or the QR code rescanned, in order to initiate a new casting session.
       Note that this policy only affects how long a cast devices appears in the Google Cast menu, and has no effect on any ongoing cast session which will continue even if the period expires.
       This policy has no effect unless the AccessCodeCastEnabled policy is Enabled.

** FastPairEnabled — Enable Fast Pair (fast Bluetooth pairing)
SYNOPSIS: true
 Setting this policy will force Fast Pair to be enabled or disabled.
       Fast Pair is a new Bluetooth pairing flow that links paired peripherals with a GAIA account.
       This allows other Chrome OS (and Android) devices signed in with the same GAIA account to pair automatically.

** CORSNonWildcardRequestHeadersSupport — CORS non-wildcard request headers support
SYNOPSIS: true
 Configures support of CORS non-wildcard request headers.

       Google Chrome version 97 introduces support for CORS non-wildcard request headers. When scripts make a cross-origin network request via fetch() and XMLHttpRequest with a script-added Authorization header, the header must be explicitly allowed by the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in the CORS preflight response. "Explicitly" here means that the wild card symbol "*" doesn't cover the Authorization header. See https://www.chromest atus.com/feature/5768642492891136 for more detail.

       If this policy is not set, or set to True, Google Chrome will support the CORS non-wildcard request headers and behave as described above.

       When this policy is set to False, chrome will allow the wildcard symbol ("*") in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in the CORS preflight response to cover the Authorization header.

       This Enterprise policy is temporary; it's intended to be removed after Google Chrome version 103.
