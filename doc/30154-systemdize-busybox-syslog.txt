Short version: we have to use rsyslogd now.


Central Logging (syslog)
==========================

These are the facts:

* Debian always ships busybox (for the ramdisk, but it's available in userland).
* Debian includes syslogd there.
* In wheezy, we did::

    apt-get install busybox-syslogd
    echo SYSLOG_OPTS='"-C8192 -LRlogserv"' >/etc/default/busybox-syslogd

  This means that it stores the last 8MB of logs in RAM,
  and forwards all logs to the host "logserv".

  We like this because MORE CODE = MORE BAD.

  It's footprint is roughly this::

    USER  PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    root 2943  0.0  0.2 19260 10320 ?   Ss   Jul15   0:01 /sbin/syslogd -C8192 -LRlogserv


* In jessie, systemd is the default.
  We are scared to replace it.

* systemd takes over local logging by default (journald).
  We are scared to disable that.

* journald can't send syslog-protocol UDP datagrams (RFC 5426),
  so *for that one thing* we need a syslogd.



* busybox syslogd is configured at COMPILE TIME to use AF_UNIX to /dev/log.
  This cannot be changed at runtime.

* systemd creates /dev/log -> /run/systemd/journal/dev-log (NB: *NOT* /syslog).
  Apparently the expected process is:

  * userland programs (e.g. logger) write to /dev/log.
  * systemd reads from /dev/log.
  * systemd writes to /run/systemd/journal/syslog.
  * "real" syslog reads from /run/systemd/journal/syslog.


* HISTORICAL: Early on, I had a problem where rsyslog was starting
  before the network was up, or before "logserv" would resolve.
  I tried to work around this with::

      >>$t/lib/systemd/system/rsyslog.service printf %s\\n [Unit] After='network.service nss-lookup.target'

  but it never worked, because I typo'd the path (not shown here).
  By the time I understood what I did wrong, the symptom was gone.
  (Probably because I stopped trying to use systemd-networkd.)
