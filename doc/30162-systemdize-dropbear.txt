Short version: we still can't use dropbear on desktop SOEs.


This is how you switch to dropbear:

* change openssh-server to dropbear in the ps=() install list
* change openssh-server to dropbear in the dpkg-statoverride list.
* disable it in the ramdisk (prior to last ramdisk rebuild)::

    xs=(/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount/dropbear
        /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-premount/devpts
        /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/dropbear
        /usr/share/initramfs-tools/conf-hooks.d/dropbear)
    >$t/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/10no-ssh-in-rd  printf 'path-exclude %s\n' "${xs[@]}"

* start it nicely in "daemon mode" (more reliable)::

    # FIXME: dropbear has no equivalent of "AllowGroups root" or "MaxStartups". --twb, Apr 2015
    # NB: KillMode=process prevents systemd from killing your existing connection when you restart SSH.
    >$t/etc/systemd/system/dropbear.service cat <<EOF
    [Unit]
    [Service]
    KillMode=process
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/dropbear -F -s -R -W 1048576

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    chroot $t systemctl enable dropbear

* OR start it nicely in "socket mode" (less load)::

    >$t/etc/systemd/system/dropbear.socket  cat <<EOF
    [Unit]
    [Socket]
    ListenStream=22
    Accept=yes

    [Install
    WantedBy=sockets.target
    EOF

    >$t/etc/systemd/system/dropbear@.service cat <<EOF
    [Unit]
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/dropbear -i -F -s -R -W 1048576
    StandardInput=socket
    StandardError=journal
    EOF

    chroot $t systemctl enable dropbear@.service dropbear.socket
    chroot $t systemctl mask dropbear.service    # disable the sysvinit version



SHOW STOPPER
------------

Dropbear on Debian doesn't use PAM and therefore uses a hard-coded,
incorrect, PATH, preventing us from running 'shutdown' on desktops.

strace indicates dropbear isn't reading anything we can patch,
like /etc/profile

Options
-------

* Compile Debian's Dropbear with PAM support

  Requires maintaining our own package

* Patch Dropbear's hard-coded PATH to include {/usr,}/sbin iff UID==0

  Requires maintaining our own package

* Switch back to OpenSSH, and write/steal a systemd unit to generate SSH
  keys on boot

  This will mean keys get generated earlier when there's less entropy

* patch server to pass ssh command on stdin instead of CLI -- yukky
  because allocates a tty

  i.e.    ssh host shutdown
  becomes echo shutdown | ssh host

  server change --> breaks backcompat

* change root's login shell to a bash wrapper that fixes path

* patch command="PATH=...; $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND" onto the
  authorized_keys line used by the server (needn't do it for personal
  keys)

* follow systemd's advice and put *everything* in /usr/bin, /sbin &c
  are symlinks only.  Bound to break stuff & currently we expect to
  have >1 version of shutdown that loads depending on $PATH.

* patch server to pass full path to shutdown & root-notify-send, &
  hope they don't need /sbin for anything (or patch them as well)

* assume server only calls shutdown & root-notify-send & put them in
  /bin or /usr/bin & have them fix $PATH if necessary

----------------------------------------------------------------------


2018 / Debian 9 Update
======================

* dropbear binaries, init scripts, and initrd integration are now packaged separately.

  * to get the first two, install "dropbear-run".
  * to get the first alone, install "dropbear-bin".

* even /sbin isn't in $PATH! --- this is worse than I misremembered. ::

    $ ssh tweak,bentham-wing-e4 'whoami; echo $PATH'
    root
    /usr/bin:/bin

* These work::

    $ ssh -oUserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -M -fNL 5901:127.1:5900 tweak,bentham-wing-e4
    2018-03-09T14:17:53.236294+11:00 bentham-wing-e4 dropbear[503]: Child connection from 10.128.0.1:57954

    $ ssh tweak,bentham-wing-e4 /usr/local/sbin/root-notify-send <<< 'I WILL GET YOU MY PRETTY AND YOUR LITTLE DOG TOO'

    2018-03-09T14:21:34.822866+11:00 bentham-wing-e4 su[815]: pam_unix(su:session): session closed for user p123

* This creates a popup (PATH= is needed because shutdown calls root-notify-send).
  It also claims to have queued the shutdown, which you can see from other open terminals.

    $ ssh tweak,bentham-wing-e4 env PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin bash -x /usr/local/sbin/shutdown -h +10

* So to adopt dropbear without regressions, I need to

  * on server, patch ppcadm to use /sbin/shutdown.
  * on desktop SOEs, dpkg-divert --rename /sbin/shutdown.
  * on desktop SOEs, install our shutdown wrapper to /sbin/shutdown.
  * on desktop SOEs, install root-notify-send to /bin or /usr/bin.
  * If HCC or Marngoneet ever new SOEs without upgrading their server, install notified-shutdown and client-notify.sh to /bin or /usr/bin.

  Since the first item can't be done in lockstep with the other changes, an interim workaround is

  * on ALL SOEs, symlink /bin/shutdown -> /sbin/shutdown

* PS: there is an even simpler/safer sshd called tinyssh, but it is currently only available in beta release on buster (Debian 10).

    13:50 <twb> Hey I noticed that Debian 10 has a new SSH server called "tinysshd".  https://mojzis.com/software/tinyssh/  https://tinyssh.org/
    13:50 <twb> Anybody have an opinion on it?
    13:50 <BasketCase> are you running an embedded system?
    13:51 <twb> not strictly speaking, no
    13:51 <BasketCase> because it looks like something you use when you are running from a floppy
    13:51 <twb> My smallest systems use about 128MB of nonvolatile storage
    13:52 <twb> not counting LEDE stuff
    13:52 <BasketCase> otoh, it seems like it uses modern tech as opposed to dropbear
    13:52 <twb> It doesn't even implement RSA or challenge-response auth at all
    13:53 <BasketCase> I only know what is on https://mojzis.com/software/tinyssh/ and I think it might be a great replacement for dropbear
    13:53 <twb> what crypto library does dropbear use?
    13:53 <twb> Note that dropbear includes an SSH client, which this doesn't
    13:53 <BasketCase> dropbear is RSA and DSA
    13:53 <twb> No I mean does it use openssl or what
    13:54 <twb> dropbear in debian does at least ECDSA as well FYI
    13:54 <BasketCase> ECDSA is shit
    13:54 <BasketCase> I turn it off
    13:55 <twb> Fair enough
    13:56 <BasketCase> I am not a dropbear expert but when I look at the dependency chain in Gentoo portage I don't see any crypto stuff so I guess it is self contained
    13:57 <twb> wikipedia indicates they have embedded copies from some third party
    13:57 <twb> dropbear homepage says something about LibTomCrypt
    13:57 <BasketCase> that sounds vague
    13:58 <twb> tinysshd appears to use "nacl" which is *not* the chrome plugin thing, but an unrelated crypto library from djb
    13:58 <BasketCase> neither should even be considered for non-embedded use
    13:58 <BasketCase> if it is from DJB it would support ed25519 not ecdsa
    13:59 <twb> *tinysshd* (not dropbear) uses nacl
    14:00 <twb> Oh actually no, it "has its own crypto library compatible with nacl" and "can be compiled using nacl"
    14:01 <BasketCase> I don't claim to know anything about nacl.  This is the first time I have heard of it.
    14:02 <twb> me too
    14:02 <twb> it's https://nacl.cr.yp.to/ https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/ linked from https://tinyssh.org/
    14:03 <BasketCase> I asked my [Gentoo] package manager about nacl and I got this: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/qpsmwCLykWtnTKEgH27M/
    14:04 <BasketCase> so, there is a 0. version from 2011 that not even Gentoo would accept as useful
    14:10 <BasketCase> otoh, your link is is from 2016 so maybe it isn't quire as obsolete as I thought
    14:11 <twb> https://nacl.cr.yp.to/install.html  still says 2011
    14:12 <BasketCase> I am a big DJB fan.  I am not familiar with nacl but it looks like something DJB would do.
    14:14 <BasketCase> you have convinced me to take another look at tinyssh tomorrow
    14:15 <BasketCase> it might be useful in small environments
    14:15 <twb> Hrm, "2017.12 update: I'm moving this group off Google. Google doesn't make this easy so you have to resubscribe, sorry: https://cr.yp.to/lists.html"
    14:16 <twb> Which doesn't let me see a pipermail archive of the old emails :-/
