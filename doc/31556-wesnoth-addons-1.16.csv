With a variety of special stealth options and hiding abilities at your disposal, your ragtag team of thieves must take on the combined might of the royal empire. You will be outnumbered and overpowered, but you have the skillz.

- Improved Act III Prologue dialogues slightly.
- Added some leftout details for Act III Prologue.

Current known issues:

- In Act I first undead boss might some times jump to fight you very unprotected making it easy to surround him and kill him.
- In Act II on easy difficulty AI might recruit more ruffians and very few thugs. This is unintended but it helps ease the difficulty.
- Both Koedem and Robin are footpads, this is temporary.
- Hard difficulty is considered unbalanced/untested.

Galuldur's First Journey

While the belligerence of orcs is nothing new, their intensifying attacks on a fledgling colony of elves in Pindir Forest begin to show signs of a deeper malice, forcing Galuldur, the young son of the colony's adventurous founder Galur, to venture out of his forest's friendly trees in search of help. His simple errand quickly turns into a frantic quest to unearth the roots of the mysterious evil threatening his people. As you lead him through unknown lands, Galuldur, forced to match wits with unexpected adversaries at nearly every turn in a desperate attempt to save his world, quickly learns that the world is neither a friendly nor a simple place.

Intermediate level. 8 or 9 scenarios depending on choices made in game. Complete.

Pax Romana: The Rise of Vespasian

Follow a young Roman plebeian named Vespasian in his rise to the rank of Emperor of Rome. This campaign contains 18 scenarios. Many atwork comes from the Imperial Era (mainly Turin's sprites). I'd like to thank UnwiseOwl for allowing me to use them. The language of the texts is not of high quality since I've always been English-challenged.


Only the 'easy' difficulty level is available for selection.

NB: to play this campaign, you have to load the core 'Bienvenue' available after the dependency add-on is installed. You'll be ready to select the 'Pax Romana' scenario through the 'Campaign' menu.

The needed 'core' can be loaded following these steps:
-   Start wesnoth and go to -> 'Preferences' -> 'Hotkeys' 
-   In 'Search' box, enter 'core'
-   Press 'Add Hotkey' then press CTRL+SHIFT+k, and close dialog.

-   In main 'Title Screen', press CTRL+SHIFT+k to open 'core' selection dialog.
-   Select item 'Bienvenue (Wesnoth 1.14 core)'.

The next time you start Battle for Wesnoth, it will start with the last active core.
To go back to 1.16: you have to press CTRL+SHIFT+k and select the 'Wesnoth (Default)' core.

From looking at the code, it looked like the numbers for EASY and HARD all had midpoints between them that would make for a good NORMAL difficulty, so I went and created just such a difficulty. I also went and made some other changes, too: since the mainline tutorial suggests playing A Tale of Two Brothers directly after finishing the tutorial, I went and made the EASY difficulty here more tutorial-like, because as it stood, the mainline A Tale of Two Brothers never felt like as good of a followup to the tutorial as The South Guard or An Orcish Incursion did. Also, the Dark Adept Muff Toras has some new roles to play on all 3 difficulties. There are a few other new surprises to find as well, so be sure to try all 3 difficulties!

Original premise:
In the first years of the Northern Alliance, an expedition from Knalga seeks out their kin at Kal Kartha and to learn the fate of the legendary Hammer of Thursagan. The perils of their journey through the wild Northern Lands, though great, pale beside the evil they will face at its end.

(Upper-intermediate level, 11 scenarios.)

Fight the overpowerered enemies with overpowerered allies, overcome the overwhelming boss battles and expect the nastiest things at the most unexpected moments.

Plot and dialogue is mostly unchanged, you can play this campaign if you haven't played the original one, but, naturally, there are obvious deviations from the mainline lore. Translations for the most part of the campaign are used from the mainline.

Heavily influenced by the addons “Invasion from the Unknown” and “After the Storm”.

Music addon “Project Thursagan Music” is recommended for a better atmosphere of epicness.

Have fun and good luck, you will need it A LOT! ;)

<i>This is the light version of Strange Legacy, with a smaller size, but no portraits, story images and sounds. 
For a better experience with portraits and included sounds, you can download the full version.</i>

The Orc invasion came without warning and with a brutality that caught the Human Alliance completely off guard and unprepared for. Before the year was over the Orcs controlled half of the Northland. The Winter finally halted their advance. Meh, what's the big deal. I never cared much for politics or policy. But when my uncle was gone, I started into the greatest adventure of my life.

This campaign is a classical rpg that offers a variety of options, you will just control one hero and bring him to fortune. You can trade, pickpocket, be a bard, bounty- or treasurehunter, or working as a craftsman selling your goods. You can also run a building and upgrade it or doing random generated missions. There are a lot of ways to make a fortune. But the world around isn't always friendly and it will react on your character level. You might encounter thieves, orcs, bandits or wild animals and therefore you will need a proper equipment to defend yourself.

Equip your charcter with: helmets, armors, shoes, shields, instruments, rings, amulets, ranged or meleeweapons or learn more than 80 powerful spells to gain an advantage. Hire one of 35 mercs to defend your load and recall them using your warhorn. Try to conquer an enemy town to gain a constant tax income. Encounter all kind of enemies each on changing maps, according to the terrain - even your ship might be attacked by naga warriors or dangerous pirates. Follow the storyline with 34 missions that will force you to explore the world of Strange legacy. A new amla system will allow you to create a character in the way you like him, allowing you to solve the game differently each time you play and the difficulty is increasing with each level up. 
For the most recent changes check the forum thread. Equip your uncles house with furniture allowing you to craft weapons, armors and cook food. If you like to have a classic RPG try out the RPG Mode. Have fun!

But when my uncle was gone, I started into the greatest adventure of my life.

This campaign is a classical rpg that offers a variety of options, you will just control one hero and bring him to fortune. You can trade, pickpocket, be a bard, bounty- or treasurehunter, or working as a craftsman selling your goods. You can also run a building and upgrade it or doing random generated missions. There are a lot of ways to make a fortune. But the world around isn't always friendly and it will react on your character level. You might encounter thieves, orcs, bandits or wild animals and therefore you will need a proper equipment to defend yourself.

Equip your charcter with: helmets, armors, shoes, shields, instruments, rings, amulets, ranged or meleeweapons or learn more than 80 powerful spells to gain an advantage. Hire one of 35 mercs to defend your load and recall them using your warhorn. Try to conquer an enemy town to gain a constant tax income. Encounter all kind of enemies each on changing maps, according to the terrain - even your ship might be attacked by naga warriors or dangerous pirates. Follow the storyline with 34 missions that will force you to explore the world of Strange legacy. A new amla system will allow you to create a character in the way you like him, allowing you to solve the game differently each time you play and the difficulty is increasing with each level up. 
For the most recent changes check the forum thread. Equip your uncles house with furniture allowing you to craft weapons, armors and cook food. If you like to have a classic RPG try out the RPG Mode. Have fun!

Witness the descructive power of the savagest alliance ever forged between orcs and dark elves, and learn of his damnation by having brought justice to those with unforgivable sins.

-- Scenarios 1-4 should be polished enough for regular play.
-- Scenario 5 should function, but may not be polished.
-- Scenario 6 is incomplete, but is playable. The rest of the campaign remains unfinished.
-- This add-on has been uploaded for archival purposes, and to those curious what the original version of Red Winter was like.

Red Winter is replaced by Red Winter Reborn, which remakes the entirity of this campaign from the ground up. You can find it on this Add-On server.

Note: This addon includes some UMC music, which is included in this campaign. This is why the file size is relatively large.

(Intermediate level, 17 scenarios, 4 dialogue only, work in progress)

This campaign includes several hundred custom units most of which were taken from (or derived from) the Reign of the Lords Era add-on by The_Gnat and some of the mainline campaigns. A huge thanks goes to The_Gnat for letting me use his fantastic Era for this campaign. I highly recommend trying out the Reign of the Lords add-on for yourself.

This campaign shall see you fight with, and against, a wide variety of factions with changing objectives and use of custom items you can find in certain scenarios. With custom units providing a wide range of choices of advancements for your units, and unique AMLAs for certain heroes, you should not worry about running out of ways to strengthen your army.


This campaign includes repeated references to mainline campaign lore, so it is recommended (although not strictly necessary) to first play Northern Rebirth and Eastern Invasion. There are also some minor references to The Legend of Wesmere, Heir to the Throne, and Delfador's Memoirs.

This is a work in progress released for Pre-Alpha testing.

This campaign is partly translated to Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) up to and including Scenario 11 thanks to the efforts of ERROR1025 (thank you for your contributions).

Note: All future updates will occur on version 1.18 of the Wesnoth add-on server.

However, despite the habits of Alduin's wizards of digging up and recording every notable historical event, the story of the beginning of his baffling rise remained unknown and marred until Elynia, his heroic wife - and then his greatest enemy -, decided to risk publishing some passages from his diaries that he wrote to overcome the amnesia that afflicts those who wander between dimensional gates or Shassangoth the Immortal.
