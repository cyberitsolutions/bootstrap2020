Doing a simple "make oldconfig" is untenable.
I just tried that again (from inmate 3.5 to 3.12) and it
 - turned on bad things without asking
 - didn't boot ("mount: Protocol not supported" in ramdisk)

Here's my strategy for how we should generate inmate kernels, moving forward.

   Build staff chroot w/wheezy bpo kernel (currently 3.12).
   Chroot into it.
   Add deb-src and apt-get build-dep & source the bpo kernel.
   Copy /boot/config-<bpo version> to .config -- this is our starting base.
   Turn options on/off (with scripts/config -e/-d) to get what we want.
   rm .version
   make silentoldconfig (reports errors; normalizes .config)
   make -j4 deb-pkg     (build the actual .deb)
   Copy build script, .config and .deb to /srv/apt/prisonpc-desktop/

Making a script (instead of .config) the canonical format means

 + we can have comments
 + we can specify the source kernel and .config
 + we can add greps (after silentoldconfig) to double-check that bad
   options are off, and good options are on.

 - It's currently about one-third the size of a pure .config.
   That's a LOT of boring CONFIG_xxx lines.

 - It's more effort.
   (Though I think we're much more likely to get a good result.)

 - New kernels add new drivers, which debian's config will enable.
   We will need to catch & blacklist these.

Should we start from "make defconfig" instead?
More things to enable, but maybe fewer changes overall.


The start of this is in client/kernel/manual-disable.sh &
README-inmate-kernel in the wheezy branch, but it's not in a usable
state ATM.
