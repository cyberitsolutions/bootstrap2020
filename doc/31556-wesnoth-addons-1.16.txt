In the cycle before our own, the civilization of the First Gods was eradicated by a cataclysmic force that was beyond their control. On the brink of utter destruction, the few survivors harnessed the ten aspects of creation to end their cycle and shape the development of a new universe. In the process, however, many errors were introduced into the fabric of the new worlds, which would eventually resurface when the Guardians of the new universe began to unveil the secrets of their creation.

(Expert level, Episode 1 - 23 scenarios)

	Feedback is welcome and necessary. This campaign is very rough around the edges. It is also practically fractal in its vast quantities of edges, and <sarcasm>definitely not</sarcasm> an excuse for a campaign with the Aragwaith as the main faction. If you find the campaign hard, I recommend that you mostly recruit Guards (level 2/3 swordsmen) and a few leadership units (level 2/3/4 spearmen).

	Feedback is welcome and necessary. This campaign is very new, and any help in balancing - especially on Hard - would be great.
	If you find the campaign inordinately hard, I recommend that you mostly recruit spearmen and a few archers. Intelligent spearmen become Flagbearers, because they need a lot of XP to get to level 4 leadership bonus, while the others (especially Strong and Resilient ones) become Pikemen. Meanwhile, your archers should become Slayers if strong (they get a good melee attack) or Greatbows if resilient (marksmanship, but fewer HP). Any swordsmen should become Guards, because they are pretty much your only units which can withstand a counterattack. Oh, and the magician heroine can recruit, which is nice because at level 3 she can teleport and move between the frontlines to heal and your keep to get reinforcements almost instantaneously.

 description = Marauding Thieves is a singleplayer campaign that takes a totally different approach to Wesnoth gameplay. Here, stealth and evasion count for more than brute strength. Why charge at a guard when you can sneak past, assassinate him from the shadows or simply plant a bomb behind his back? Combat is for losers!

    The campaign takes place across a series of missions which are selected by the player on a world map of Wesnoth. There are four mission types with a variety of unique objectives (loot the chests, rescue the prisoners, blow the bridge!). With a variety of special stealth options and hiding abilities at your disposal, your ragtag team of thieves must take on the combined might of the royal empire. You will be outnumbered and overpowered, but you have the skillz.

This is a fork of 'Den of Thieves' by Bob_The_Mighty & jb.

To play the original multiplayer version with 2 or 3 players, please download their copy instead.
Marauding Thieves is the Single Player variation. It should be started from the 'Campaigns' button found at the main screen, and not from the Multiplayer setup screens.

Not necessarily set in the Wesnoth universe, it is set on a feudal continent where war, betrayal and death are commonplace.

Changelog:
0.0.2c
- Fixed story map compression.
0.0.2b
- Fixed and improved story map slightly.
- Improved Act III Prologue dialogues slightly.
- Added some leftout details for Act III Prologue.
- Added some missing variables for Act III Prologue.
Current known issues:
- In Act I undead can get corpses twice from the same village if it gets captured and recaptured. Unintended but shouldn't affect gameplay in a significant way.
- In Act I first undead boss might some times jump to fight you very unprotected making it easy to surround him and kill him.
- In Act II on easy difficulty AI might recruit more ruffians and very few thugs. This is unintended but it helps ease the difficulty.
- Both Koedem and Robin are footpads, this is temporary.
- Hard difficulty is considered unbalanced/untested.

0.0.2
- Added Act II and Act III-pre (This is a new cutscene in preparation for Act III Variation A, B and C, which are not added yet).
- Added map for story journey.
- Improved Prologue and Act I dialogues.
- Improved Act I choices.
- Improved Prologue movements.
- Improved Story writing.
- Added changelog here.

0.0.1b
- Fixed one bug

0.0.1
- Initial release including Prologue and Act I.

Galuldur's First Journey

While the belligerence of orcs is nothing new, their intensifying attacks on a fledgling colony of elves in Pindir Forest begin to show signs of a deeper malice, forcing Galuldur, the young son of the colony's adventurous founder Galur, to venture out of his forest's friendly trees in search of help. His simple errand quickly turns into a frantic quest to unearth the roots of the mysterious evil threatening his people. As you lead him through unknown lands, Galuldur, forced to match wits with unexpected adversaries at nearly every turn in a desperate attempt to save his world, quickly learns that the world is neither a friendly nor a simple place.

Intermediate level. 8 or 9 scenarios depending on choices made in game. Complete.

(Original version: 1.3.0; last updated on Mar 31 2018)


NB: to play this campaign, you have to load the core 'Bienvenue' available after the dependency add-on is installed. You'll be ready to select the 'Galuldur's First Journey' scenario through the 'Campaign' menu.

The needed 'core' can be loaded following these steps:
-   Start wesnoth and go to -> 'Preferences' -> 'Hotkeys' 
-   In 'Search' box, enter 'core'
-   Press 'Add Hotkey' then press CTRL+SHIFT+k, and close dialog.

-   In main 'Title Screen', press CTRL+SHIFT+k to open 'core' selection dialog.
-   Select item 'Bienvenue (Wesnoth 1.14 core)'.

The next time you start Battle for Wesnoth, it will start with the last active core.
To go back to 1.16: you have to press CTRL+SHIFT+k and select the 'Wesnoth (Default)' core.

Please do not report any problem with this add-on in the official feedback thread for 'Galuldur's First Journey'.

This campaign was developed several years ago and has been extended with help from esci, Seivn, gnombat, vghetto, enclave, and finally me (Argothair). It is currently optimized for Wesnoth v1.15. I am responsible for adding the most recent gameplay changes, such as iron, diplomacy, rebalanced building costs, and more naturalistic animal behavior. 

It's possible that these changes have thrown off the game balance or otherwise created some bugs! Please feel free to send complaints to jasongreenlowe@gmail.com; if the bug is serious enough or easy enough to fix, I will likely take care of it.

Very interesting project if you like to build (ANL, A new land, Undead Empire, New Settlers, Civ)

 description = Warning: The official updated campaigns are distributed as part of mainline.

This is an attempt to recover translations for four 1.14 campaigns before overhaul. This is brought to you with no warranty.

The goal of this add-on is to make these campaigns available again to play in fully translated version.
This is done by using outdated scenarios, so there may be playability and balance issues and shortcomings in the plot.

Available translations: German (de), French (fr), Catalan (ca), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Dutch (nl).
Experimental translation: Sardinian (srd; you have to select the Burmese (mranmabhasa) language to see Sardinian instead).

The campaigns are released as part of a 'core', they can be selected following these steps:
-   Start wesnoth and go to -> 'Preferences' -> 'Hotkeys' 
-   In 'Search' box, enter 'core'
-   Press 'Add Hotkey' then press CTRL+SHIFT+k, and close dialog.

-   In main 'Title Screen', press CTRL+SHIFT+k to open 'core' selection dialog.
-   Select 'Wesnoth (1.14)' core.
-   The 1.14 campaigns are now available in the 'Campaigns' menu.

The next time you start Battle for Wesnoth, it will start with the last active core.
To go back to 1.16: you have to press CTRL+SHIFT+k and select the 'Wesnoth (Default)' core.

Please do not report any problem with this add-on in the official feedback threads for mainline campaigns.

Available campaigns:
-   Descent into Darkness (1.14)
-   Liberty (1.14)
-   The Sceptre of Fire (1.14)

 description = Create your own 4-scenario campaign without typing any complicated code! There are only 3 steps. 

Step 1: locate the "DIY Campaign" folder in the "add-ons" folder, open it and get a basic understanding of how the contents are organized. 
    
Step 2: open the Map Editor and load the map called "01_location.map," located in the "maps" folder. Add villages, mountains, and so forth to the map, then save it to record the changes. Repeat this process with the other 3 maps. Be sure to use Save Map to record the changes, not Save Scenario - that's something different. 
    
Step 3: open the scenario file called "01_scenario.cfg" using a basic Text Editor. Find the lines where "Ogre" and other unit types are written, then replace those units with units of your choosing. Do this for sides 1 and 2. You must use a unit's offical name, including capitalization. For example, don't type "orc," type "Orcish Grunt." Do this with all 4 scenario files, and save each file to record the changes. That's it! 
    
The scenarios were written in WML, a coding language which uses regular words, such as "turns" and "gold," making it easy to modify the scenarios by simply changing numbers. Do you want more gold in a particular scenario? Increase the number! Making a campaign has never been easier!

The large map was designed to allow brilliant attacks and retreats in battle. Impassible mountains and deep water prevent non-flying units from beelining across the map.

A casual player will probably win on Easy. A pretty good player will enjoy a nice challenge on Normal. Hard is winnable, but definitely hard.

Memories from another world
The Season of the Mist

The currents of time flow slowly in the younger lands. However, as the world ages, both those currents and the cycles that follow them begin to accelerate, forcing all the living beings to adapt into a less placed pace. In the eyes of the elven citizens, such rapid changes pose a threat to their lifestyle, and those born in the lower castes are sent into the outside world in hopes of completely avoid unexpected changes or delay them as much as possible.

Pax Romana: The Rise of Vespasian

Follow a young Roman plebeian named Vespasian in his rise to the rank of Emperor of Rome. This campaign contains 18 scenarios. Many atwork comes from the Imperial Era (mainly Turin's sprites). I'd like to thank UnwiseOwl for allowing me to use them. The language of the texts is not of high quality since I've always been English-challenged.


Only the 'easy' difficulty level is available for selection.

NB: to play this campaign, you have to load the core 'Bienvenue' available after the dependency add-on is installed. You'll be ready to select the 'Pax Romana' scenario through the 'Campaign' menu.

The needed 'core' can be loaded following these steps:
-   Start wesnoth and go to -> 'Preferences' -> 'Hotkeys' 
-   In 'Search' box, enter 'core'
-   Press 'Add Hotkey' then press CTRL+SHIFT+k, and close dialog.

-   In main 'Title Screen', press CTRL+SHIFT+k to open 'core' selection dialog.
-   Select item 'Bienvenue (Wesnoth 1.14 core)'.

The next time you start Battle for Wesnoth, it will start with the last active core.
To go back to 1.16: you have to press CTRL+SHIFT+k and select the 'Wesnoth (Default)' core.

Please do not report any problem with this add-on in the official feedback thread for 'Pax Romana: The Rise of Vespasian'.

Changelog:
    0.9.1 : Added updated Japanese translation and fixed a bunch of stuff
    0.9.0 : Added 5 scenarios (3 battles) and modified scenarios 11 and 19 to require players remain near their docks
    0.8.1 : Added updated Japanese translation
    0.8.0 : 2 new levels (all battles) and a few changes in portraits
    0.7.0 : 5 new levels (but only 2 battles), a way to see the credits and some rebalancing on scenarios 22 through 26
    0.6.1 : Fixed misnamed japanese translation files and enemy gold on easy on scenario 26
    0.6.0 : 6 new levels (4 battles), Japanese translation (though not for the newest levels)
    0.5.2 : French translation, music, miscellaneous
    0.5.1 : Fixed missing translation marks and objective
    0.5.0 : Added 3 scenarios (2 battles) after the existing ones
    0.4.0 : Added 4 scenarios (3 battles) after the existing ones
    0.3.6 : Fixed a mistake leftover from testing...
    0.3.5 : Added 3 scenarios (3 battles) after the existing ones
    0.3.0 : Added 4 scenarios (3 battles, 1 talk-only) after the existing ones
    0.2.0 : Added 3 scenarios (one at the start, two at the end) and a little flourish to ex-scenario 2 (now 3)
    0.1.3 : Added scenario files to help the transition with the fact that I changed scenarios id
        (if it crashed before when opening a new scenario or saying next scenario missing this should fix it... normally)
    0.1.2 : Fixed carryover problems with the 'waiting' scenarios (the end of current content ones)
    0.1.1 : Rebalanced scenarios 1 and 3 (and thus 2 as well)

If you have a save from an older version (pre 0.2.0) then some things might not work (I added a new 'first' scenario and I had messed up a few things), but it should be obvious if that's the case (the 'your heroes all being level 1 with no xp' kind of obvious). It should be fixable by reloading a save before the 'waiting' scenario but I'm not sure, sorry...
Added note: this is the last version where they might work.

Please note: that the porting of this UMC is ongoing and more follow up patches will be done in due time.

I ported this from the 1.8.x add-ons server since I liked how these campaigns by WYRMY stick quite close to good/decent quality and take some references from IftU for its gameplay and mechanics.

Anyways, the port works from start to end but there are some non-breakage bugs here and there. Might need a new forum topic ID as well as the previous thread is over 12 years old

From looking at the code, it looked like the numbers for EASY and HARD all had midpoints between them that would make for a good NORMAL difficulty, so I went and created just such a difficulty. I also went and made some other changes, too: since the mainline tutorial suggests playing A Tale of Two Brothers directly after finishing the tutorial, I went and made the EASY difficulty here more tutorial-like, because as it stood, the mainline A Tale of Two Brothers never felt like as good of a followup to the tutorial as The South Guard or An Orcish Incursion did. Also, the Dark Adept Muff Toras has some new roles to play on all 3 difficulties. There are a few other new surprises to find as well, so be sure to try all 3 difficulties!

 description = Pretty much the same campaign you are used to... Wait, is that a Mechanical Goliath?!

Original premise:
In the first years of the Northern Alliance, an expedition from Knalga seeks out their kin at Kal Kartha and to learn the fate of the legendary Hammer of Thursagan. The perils of their journey through the wild Northern Lands, though great, pale beside the evil they will face at its end.

(Upper-intermediate level, 11 scenarios.)

Fight the overpowerered enemies with overpowerered allies, overcome the overwhelming boss battles and expect the nastiest things at the most unexpected moments.

Plot and dialogue is mostly unchanged, you can play this campaign if you haven't played the original one, but, naturally, there are obvious deviations from the mainline lore. Translations for the most part of the campaign are used from the mainline.

Heavily influenced by the addons “Invasion from the Unknown” and “After the Storm”.

Music addon “Project Thursagan Music” is recommended for a better atmosphere of epicness.

Have fun and good luck, you will need it A LOT! ;)

There are some special hero units and I plan to add more new unit types. Some scenarios have mechanics, which will allow you to play in a different way than usual, but it is mostly the classic tBfW experience. At first you have a limited unit variety, but it will be diversified later on. 

I would be happy for any feedback (Balancing, grammar/spelling, bugs, plot holes, etc.) on the forum.

Ca. two thirds done (15/22 Scenarios).

This is a low-power campaign. The gold is going to be scarce, the bulk of your units will be level 0 and the enemy AI will strategize against you.

I draw my inspiration from games like Myth: The Fallen Lords, Homeworld and Sunless Sea. Undead are the main antagonist, while your unit roster grows more varied over time.

Currently there are two levels. Third level is going to comprise some kind of early ending.

I invite potential collaborators. Characters still use placeholder names and portraits, while some plot details are still missing. My ideas are mostly for level design and puzzles.

If you are interested, please send me an email.

michal.bajczyk@gmail.com

There are several ways to finish each level. I am curious of everyone's unique approach and solution. If you want to show me how YOU beat my challenge, please send email to this forum thread:

- Command a force primarily on horseback. Use your speed and mobility to outflank and defeat enemies.
- New unit line of Bowrider (derived from Imperial Era). Archer unit on horseback, ideal for hit-and-run.
- New alternate advancements for Cavalryman: Holibars, highly-mobile unit with enhanced defence in villages; and Cataphracts, heavily armoured units that can withstand high damage.
- Secondary force of dwarves joining later in the campaign, featuring alternate advancements for Dwarvish Fighter and Dwarvish Thunderer.

- Switch between mounted force and dwarven force as the terrain dictates, including dismounting and remounting your main characters.

- Alternate paths that affect the whole campaign: an early decision on which path to take may have repercussions later.
- Ever-changing alliances and enemies: fight alongside outlaws, merfolk, loyalists, woses, orcs, elves, villagers and more; fight against nearly as many.

<i>This is the light version of Strange Legacy, with a smaller size, but no portraits, story images and sounds. 
For a better experience with portraits and included sounds, you can download the full version.</i>

The Orc invasion came without warning and with a brutality that caught the Human Alliance completely off guard and unprepared for. Before the year was over the Orcs controlled half of the Northland. The Winter finally halted their advance. Meh, what's the big deal. I never cared much for politics or policy. But when my uncle was gone, I started into the greatest adventure of my life.

This campaign is a classical rpg that offers a variety of options, you will just control one hero and bring him to fortune. You can trade, pickpocket, be a bard, bounty- or treasurehunter, or working as a craftsman selling your goods. You can also run a building and upgrade it or doing random generated missions. There are a lot of ways to make a fortune. But the world around isn't always friendly and it will react on your character level. You might encounter thieves, orcs, bandits or wild animals and therefore you will need a proper equipment to defend yourself.

Equip your charcter with: helmets, armors, shoes, shields, instruments, rings, amulets, ranged or meleeweapons or learn more than 80 powerful spells to gain an advantage. Hire one of 35 mercs to defend your load and recall them using your warhorn. Try to conquer an enemy town to gain a constant tax income. Encounter all kind of enemies each on changing maps, according to the terrain - even your ship might be attacked by naga warriors or dangerous pirates. Follow the storyline with 34 missions that will force you to explore the world of Strange legacy. A new amla system will allow you to create a character in the way you like him, allowing you to solve the game differently each time you play and the difficulty is increasing with each level up. 
For the most recent changes check the forum thread. Equip your uncles house with furniture allowing you to craft weapons, armors and cook food. If you like to have a classic RPG try out the RPG Mode. Have fun!

 description = Son of the Black Eye was originally designed as an expert-level campaign. In that state, it was too hard for me. While I respect the designers' decisions to make it hard, I also think players deserve an easier campaign of mainline quality where they get to play as orcs. This is my attempt to make it easy enough for even beginners to be able to handle. Note that my edits are primarily designed only to make the main objectives easier; optional objectives (such as killing enemy leaders in survival missions) still ought to be difficult. 

(18 scenarios.)

Lead Aegir, a lone dwarf who finds himself in charge of the refugees. Seek help from various allies, travel through the remains of the Wesnoth Kingdom and face a completely new foe.

Part II : The Sands of Revenge
War and deceit has thinned the numbers of Aegir's army, but it has hardenned the survivors even more! Soon the flight will end, help will come from the south and the free people of Wesnoth will have revenge !
(Intermediate level, 6 scenarios (incomplete))

Having played A Tale of Two Brothers will give the storyline more depht but is not required. Uses the 1.16.0 version of Wesnoth so will probably be buggy on older versions.

Note: This campaign features a completely new faction against which you will fight most of the time. Designed for those who have enough of fighting hordes of orcs or undead (you won't find any). I'm not an artist so the artwork might not be splendid. Im working to improve it. Soft difficulty should fit novicer players, while challenging is really meant for players who have played Wesnoth a lot. I'm working on Part II right now. Thanks for any feedback whether related to story, typo, art or balance !

The last of the Green Magi, Ani Essu, led an exodus of a dozen races to a fertile ground, the Northern Highlands.  Betrayed and murdered by those she saved, her work collapses as the refugees war with one another once again.  Two generations later, the heir to Ani's legacy, Princess Anea, is prophesied to complete the legacy or destroy it.  Is she a hero or a villain?  Only you can decide. 

Ani's Legacy - The main campaign, a non-linear campaign with eighteen different endings reachable by different user choices.  A playthrough can be from seven to twenty-six scenarios, and there are a total of 144 reachable scenarios.  After beating the campaign the first time, starting the campaign again will show you a map of the story arcs as hints about how to reach other endings.

Ani's Quest - The prequel campaign.  Despite their flaws, Ani and her band of anti-heroes lead Wesnoth refugees to the Northern Highlands.  This campaign is meant to be played after Ani's Legacy, to avoid spoilers at the end.  This is a mostly-linear campaign with an 18 scenario playthrough, and has a total of 22 reachable scenarios.

Xenoi - a multiplayer faction, which shows up as an enemy or ally in Ani's Legacy depending on user choices.  They are also briefly seen in Ani's Quest.

Both campaigns are complete and playable.

 description = In this 5-scenario campaign, you are the respected Leader of the frogfolk tribe. A malignant pool of green slime threatens the entire swamp, and it is up to you to get somehow rid of it.

The powerful army at your command consists entirely of frogs, mushrooms, and bugs. All custom-made units are thoroughly animated with attack animations, death animations, and more. 

The small maps are almost puzzle-like, and present a multitude of exciting tactical challenges.

A casual player will probably win on Easy. A pretty good player will enjoy a nice challenge on Normal. Hard is winnable, but definitely hard.

NOTE 1: This is a small campaign with a deep story. Players who skip the dialogue may become confused about what they need to accomplish.

NOTE 2: The hefty file size is due to a special animated title, which is totally worth the several extra seconds of download time, in my opinion.

Before the year was over the Orcs controlled half of the Northland. The Winter finally halted their advance. Meh, what's the big deal. I never cared much for politics or policy. But when my uncle was gone, I started into the greatest adventure of my life.

This campaign is a classical rpg that offers a variety of options, you will just control one hero and bring him to fortune. You can trade, pickpocket, be a bard, bounty- or treasurehunter, or working as a craftsman selling your goods. You can also run a building and upgrade it or doing random generated missions. There are a lot of ways to make a fortune. But the world around isn't always friendly and it will react on your character level. You might encounter thieves, orcs, bandits or wild animals and therefore you will need a proper equipment to defend yourself.

Equip your charcter with: helmets, armors, shoes, shields, instruments, rings, amulets, ranged or meleeweapons or learn more than 80 powerful spells to gain an advantage. Hire one of 35 mercs to defend your load and recall them using your warhorn. Try to conquer an enemy town to gain a constant tax income. Encounter all kind of enemies each on changing maps, according to the terrain - even your ship might be attacked by naga warriors or dangerous pirates. Follow the storyline with 34 missions that will force you to explore the world of Strange legacy. A new amla system will allow you to create a character in the way you like him, allowing you to solve the game differently each time you play and the difficulty is increasing with each level up. 
For the most recent changes check the forum thread. Equip your uncles house with furniture allowing you to craft weapons, armors and cook food. If you like to have a classic RPG try out the RPG Mode. Have fun!

While passing time in the inn and enjoying a few good drinks, his quick paced tale will take you to the cruel Northlands, where orcish warchiefs rise and fall, and the people are kept as slaves or worse. Witness the descructive power of the savagest alliance ever forged between orcs and dark elves, and learn of his damnation by having brought justice to those with unforgivable sins.

The Ravagers, revised and grander than ever, is now available for Wesnoth version 1.16.0 or newer.

 description = This is the original version of Red Winter, created back in the 1.12 days. It has been looked over to work with 1.16, but remains incomplete.
-- Scenarios 1-4 should be polished enough for regular play.
-- Scenario 5 should function, but may not be polished.
-- Scenario 6 is incomplete, but is playable. The rest of the campaign remains unfinished.
-- This add-on has been uploaded for archival purposes, and to those curious what the original version of Red Winter was like.

Red Winter is replaced by Red Winter Reborn, which remakes the entirity of this campaign from the ground up. You can find it on this Add-On server.

Note: This addon includes some UMC music, which is included in this campaign. This is why the file size is relatively large.

This campaign includes several hundred custom units most of which were taken from (or derived from) the Reign of the Lords Era add-on by The_Gnat and some of the mainline campaigns. A huge thanks goes to The_Gnat for letting me use his fantastic Era for this campaign. I highly recommend trying out the Reign of the Lords add-on for yourself.

This campaign shall see you fight with, and against, a wide variety of factions with changing objectives and use of custom items you can find in certain scenarios. With custom units providing a wide range of choices of advancements for your units, and unique AMLAs for certain heroes, you should not worry about running out of ways to strengthen your army.


This campaign includes repeated references to mainline campaign lore, so it is recommended (although not strictly necessary) to first play Northern Rebirth and Eastern Invasion. There are also some minor references to The Legend of Wesmere, Heir to the Throne, and Delfador's Memoirs.

This is a work in progress released for Pre-Alpha testing.

This campaign is partly translated to Simplified Chinese (zh_CN) up to and including Scenario 11 thanks to the efforts of ERROR1025 (thank you for your contributions).

Note: All future updates will occur on version 1.18 of the Wesnoth add-on server.

Enjoy :)

Hoping that no one will feel offended, hurted, wounded or distraught by the 'nostalgic' exhumation of some old units, I wish you all a lot of fun.

I have no intention of opening, on the forum, a thread which could be closed arbitrarily for unforeseeable reasons, so if anyone encounters problems with the campaign, he can write an email to argesilao2019@yahoo.com, or open a forum thread related to the campaign under his own responsibility.

 description = <big>There was a time when all the inhabitants of Wesnoth knew the name of Argan, the servant of Ragan, and passed his story among them from fathers to sons.
However, despite the habits of Alduin's wizards of digging up and recording every notable historical event, the story of the beginning of his baffling rise remained unknown and marred until Elynia, his heroic wife - and then his greatest enemy -, decided to risk publishing some passages from his diaries that he wrote to overcome the amnesia that afflicts those who wander between dimensional gates or Shassangoth the Immortal.
This is a story of Argan, who the light of his great accomplishments, and his heroic followers, lit up the skies of the realm of Irdya just as the darkness of his black robe threatened every living being and nearly destroyed all hope of escaping from his might.</big>
The story of the rise of a hero among heroes and a monster among monsters...
