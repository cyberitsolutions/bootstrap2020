__doc__ = """ build kernel with Debian patches and config, modulo PrisonPC policy

From https://KB.cyber.com.au/PrisonPC+Prisoner+Kernel the high-level policy is:

   =======         =====================================   ==============
   RFC2119         COMPONENT                               EXAMPLES

   MUST            Sound cards (mainstream only)
   MUST            NFSv4, SquashFS, AUFS, ISO9660, UDF

   SHOULD          NICs (1Gbps ethernet)
   MUST            Yama (LSM)

   MUST NOT        Wireless networking                     802.11, 802.15.4, BT, WIMAX, NFC
   MUST NOT        USB storage
   SHOULD NOT      All other USB

   MAY             All other input devices
   MAY             All other sound cards
   MAY             All other networking                    10M/10G ethernet, FC

   MUST NOT        Unnecessary crypto
   SHOULD NOT      Unnecessary serial

   AS NEEDED       All other buses                         1-wire, SCADA, IDE, PCI
   MAY             All other encodings                     CP437, ISO8859, KOI-8R

   SHOULD NOT      debugging
   =============   =====================================   ==============

The process is a bit messy because we combine settings from
conflicting sources.

  1. When the kernel changes (since this last run),

     a. Apply OLD debian /boot/config to CURRENT debian source.
        Run "make syncconfig" (n√©e "make oldconfig").
        This will prompt for each new thing, defaulting to the MAINLINE default.

     b. Compare OLD debian /boot/config and CURRENT debian /boot/config.
        This shows the DEBIAN setting for each new thing.

     c. Run "make menuconfig" and/or grep --include=Kconfig.
        Sometimes this view is easier to understand.

     d. A human decides if the answer should be

        * MUST or SHOULD or SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT:
          it goes into build-inmate-kernel.ini; or

        * DON'T CARE:
          it is not mentioned.

     e. move .config-current to .config-old

     f. git commit .ini and .config-old as "kernel: bump to NNN".

     This is generally quick for a single release.
     For example, 5.1 to 5.2  might have  5 new prompts.
     For example, 5.1 to 5.10 might have 50 new prompts.

  2. Once that is done, do a "real" build,
     which should be fully automated.
     It uploads to Cyber IT's apt repo, like build-misc.py.
