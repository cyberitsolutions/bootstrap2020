Description: appease libreoffice
 Inmates SHOULD NOT have access to "unnecessary" cryptography.
 .
 LibreOffice 6+ has a hard dependency on libgpgme.
 If we remove libgpgme, libreoffice won't even start.
 HOWEVER, libgpgme really just fork-and-execs /bin/gpg, then
 talks to it over stdio.
 .
 So we trick apt into shipping libgpgme but not gpg,
 all of libreoffice will work except for password-protected documents.
