prisonpc-ersatz (11.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * fix lintian debhelper-but-no-misc-depends

  * slurp Debian 9 "prisonpc-core-fonts" as "fonts-prisonpc-core".
  * slurp cjb's list as "fonts-prisonpc-extra".
  * move opendyslexic from former to latter.
  * use Noto (not DejaVu) as UI font.
  * replace a bunch more near-identical fonts
  * create fonts-prisonpc to refer to both at once.
  * miscellaneous cleanup of font packages (Debian 9 to 11).
  * add Multi-Arch: foreign due to
    https://lintian.debian.org/tags/font-package-not-multi-arch-foreign

  * libreoffice's dependency on fonts-opensymbol is versioned, so
    provide a new version.

prisonpc-ersatz (11.0) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * Fresh package for Debian 11.
    I expect to cherry-pick from the old packaging, later.

  * Try to surgically remove gpg/gnupg.
    Debian 9's apt needed full gpg, which prevented this.
