xdg-desktop-portal-ersatz (11.0) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1005230#25
    Chromium wrongly claims it needs xdg-desktop-portal-gtk | xdg-desktop-portal-backend.
    It does not.
    While I wait for a human to reply to my emails (see URL),
    create a dummy package that will prevent chromium from installing fuse and bubblewrap.

  * This belongs in prisonpc-ersatz, but if upstream responds soon, I can
    roll-back this entire stub package.  Keeping it separate makes it
    easier to redact from the apt repo.
