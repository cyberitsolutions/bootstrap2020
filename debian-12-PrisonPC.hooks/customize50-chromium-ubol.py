        #              world-writeable fixes the fucking thing
        # 10:20 <mike> Then it creates "_metadata", so maybe it only needs that directory
        # 10:20 <mike> At this point it's worth trying it as a
        #              "packed" extension because that might trigger
        #              Chromium's overlay logic stuff

        # 10:21 <twb> Sorry, I should have said that but I totally forgot
        # 10:22 <twb> I'm doing to try just mkdir _metadata first bceause that's super easy
        # 10:23 <mike> Fair call, but that_metadata directory quickly

        #              "_metadata/generated_indexed_rulesets" appear
