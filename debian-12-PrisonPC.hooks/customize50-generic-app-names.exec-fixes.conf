# By default xfburn wants to use gstreamer to transcode movies.
# We only care about burning data DVDs, so gstreamer is not installed.

# We do not want apps to be fullscreen by default for two reasons:
#
#   1. Covering the taskbar acts as a sort of "boss key",
#      making it easier to do some other (clandestine) activity.
#
#   2. Some apps, when quitting, leave the monitor resolution in a stupid state.
#      Since we hide the XFCE display settings app, this requires a reboot to fix.
