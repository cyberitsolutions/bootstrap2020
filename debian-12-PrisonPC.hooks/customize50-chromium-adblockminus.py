__doc__ = """ bare-bones 60% ad/telemetry blocker

Detainees have a default-deny list, where EVERYTHING is blocked unless it is explicitly allowed.
Staff have a default-allow list, but still have plugins disabled, so they can't install ad blockers even if they want to.
We also can't easily ship actual an ublock-origin (nÃ©e adblock-plus) plugin without other security tradeoffs.

We mostly consider this FineTM - if staff want to do personal browsing
from their PrisonPC staff account instead of their government account,
that's their business.
Also we are/were a bit concerned about breaking something.

But having recently had to do an audit/analysis of browsing history
from two staff accounts over a 1h period each, the amount of telemetry
was astonishing.
Just to make *that analysis* easier next time, do some absolute bare-bones ad blocking.

This adapts some ancient code I (twb) had set up personally to block things via /etc/hosts, so
that the blocking (i.e. protection) worked even if you were not using a GUI browser.
It looks at the some third-party block lists for uBlock Origin,
looks for anything that matches an exact domain, and adds that to Chromium's URLBlocklist.

This doesn't deal with all the e.g. "/trackingpixel.gif" rules.
This doesn't deal with any rules that look like "block all of attacker.com, but then allow benign.attacker.com" (@@).
Hopefully this list is a reasonable way to block 60% to 80% of the attack stuff, without blocking too much or too little.

NOTE: this downloads the block lists are SOE build time, so newer SOE = newer block list.

NOTE: if this causes problems, you can disable it by creating an empty
      file of the same name in site.dir/etc/chromium/policies/managed/.

UPDATE: URLAllowlist & URLDenylist each have a limit of 1000 records, and
        EasyList/EasyPrivacy has ~70,000 rules even just for host-wide rules.
        Therefore doing a full block list there is definitely untenable.
        We *can* add the records to /etc/hosts,
        although systemd-resolved requires a fair amount of RAM for those, AND
        they are not recursive (e.g. adding "example.com" won't stop "www.example.com".

        Let's try it anyway and see how bad it is...

        UPDATE: can't actually write to /etc/hosts directly, because
        some useless pre-systemd code in live-boot is replacing
        /etc/hosts outright at boot time.

        UPDATE: resolved w/ empty hosts = ~20MB
                resolved w/ 70K rules in hosts = ~40MB --- meh

        UPDATE: also this edit to /etc/hosts doesn't change v6 resolution.
