# Only start rsyslog if get-config-from-dnssd found an upstream RELP server.
# If we don't do this, then rsyslog will exit non-zero with these errors:
#
#     rsyslogd: there are no active actions configured. Inputs would run, but no output whatsoever were created. [v8.2102.0 try https://www.rsyslog.com/e/2103 ]
#     rsyslogd: run failed with error -2103 (see rsyslog.h or try https://www.rsyslog.com/e/2103 to learn what that number means)
#
# Also get-config-from-dnssd will rerun.
# This will happen in a huge loop because syslog.socket will try
# REALLY HARD to keep rsyslog running.
