# We want to say
#    apt purge x-terminal-emulator
#    apt purge ?installed?provides(^x-terminal-emulator$)
# But these don't work.
# We can hard-code the current list, but it will get out of date.
# What about if we make a stub package that has "Conflicts: x-terminal-emulator"?
# Then we'd get the same safety net, PLUS it would happen earlier in the build.  Nice!

# Barring that, we need at aptitude or dctrl-tools:
#
#     aptitude search -F%p '?provides(x-terminal-emulator)' | fmt
