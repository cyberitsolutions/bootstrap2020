// PrisonPC browser does not include an ad/telemetry blocker plugin because:
//
//   1) detainee browsing is allowlist-only anyway, and
//      bad things aren't in the squid allowlist in the first place
//
//   2) chromium is made by Google, and
//      Google is primarily an advertising company, and
//      therefore deliberately break ad blockers.
//
//   3) third-party ad blocking plugins like AdBlock Plus used to be
//      in Debian (so could be installed in /usr), but
//      these are not properly maintained anymore and basically broken (even for Firefox).
//      Instead you are expected to have unrestricted internet access to download the plugin itself,
//      and space in each user's $HOME to install and maintain separate copy there.
//
//   4) we default-deny block chrome://extensions &c, and
//      we don't want to allow those in order to load a blocker.
//
//   5) we do not necessarily trust third-party block lists to not "go rogue".
//
//   6) if the blocker blocks too much, it could break something that
//      the prison legitimately wants, and then it takes us longer to
//      debug that.  e.g. telemetry blockers can block "checking
//      you're not a robot" captchas.
//
//   7) if prison staff choose to do personal browsing (e.g. house
//      shopping) from their PrisonPC staff account, instead of their
//      government-provided windows account, we kinda DON'T CARE.
//
// HOWEVER, this did start annoying twb personally here:
// https://kb.cyber.com.au/PrisonPC%20Activity%20Report
//
// An educator's LMS was so badly outsourced that it was impossible to
// grant limited access to it, so as a workaround, a detainee was
// temporarily given direct access to a PrisonPC **staff** account to
// do their uni exams.
//
// Then that detainee was insufficiently supervised, so Cyber was
// asked to check the logs for any evidence of improper behaviour.
//
// It turns out that over ~1h there is 90,000 HTTP requests, and
// almost all of them are spyware/telemetry/advertising.
// So twb went "hrm, maybe we should add some very easy, basic
// blocking, so that the next analysis is a bit faster.  Also it
// incidentally improves PrisonPC staff experience slightly."


// NOTE: this file assumes PolicyListMultipleSourceMergeList includes
//       URLBlocklist, so
//       entries here add to (not replace) the inmate defaults.
//
//
// NOTE: this allows https://example.com and
//       blocks https://wikipedia.org:
//
//           {"URLAllowlist": [
//               "http://*",
//               "https://*"],
//            "URLBlocklist": [
//                "*",
//                "wikipedia.org"]}
//
//       so it is NOT simply doing
//
//           if url matches any URLAllowlist
//           then ALLOW
//           else if url matches any URLBlocklist
//           then BLOCK
//           else ALLOW
//
//       but rather it is doing some kind of multi-stage match.
