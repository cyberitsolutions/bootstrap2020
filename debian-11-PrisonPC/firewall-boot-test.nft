# NOTE: this file is not installed in any SOEs.
# It is copied into --boot-test's temporary site.dir.

# In production, everything runs on PrisonPC/32.
# In testing, SOME things have different IPs!
#
# I considered making the main firewall.nft use "set servers {â‹¯}", and
# having this file just edit that list, but
# it looked like it would be rather messy.
#
# Likewise, this should probably be a template that
# gets "10.0.2.x" or "10.128.2.x" from debian-11-main.py at runtime.
# That also felt excessively messy.
#
# The main counter-argument is that this approach means that VM
# testing *of the firewall itself* is prone to false-positives and
# false-negatives.  Other tests are still fine!
