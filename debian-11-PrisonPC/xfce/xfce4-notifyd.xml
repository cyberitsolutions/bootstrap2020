     Hopefully this just means inmates cannot set "do not disturb"?
     We rely on notifyd popups to say "curfew is starting soon, finish up now!".
     We don't want inmates to ignore that, altough if they do, it's not really our problem.
     UPDATE: it does not stop inmates toggling do-not-disturb=true â˜¹
     The only benefit of setting anything here is that it will reset on logout/reboot.
