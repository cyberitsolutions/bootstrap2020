// This feature is for a very specific scenario:
//
//   Mazda: "we want to switch to Chrome, but one intranet page needs IE6 (Trident engine)"
//
//   Google: "put that page in a blacklist and Chrome will render it with Trident, but inside a Chrome tab".
//
// This is COMPLETELY irrelevant for us.
// Disable this feature outright.
