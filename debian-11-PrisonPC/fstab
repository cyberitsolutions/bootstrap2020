# Hey, Emacs!   This is a -*-conf-*- file.
#
# Set merciless defaults for "API" filesystems.
# https://alloc.cyber.com.au/task/task.php?taskID=30092
# In particular: DEFAULT DENY.
# If you want to be mounted without -o nosuid,noexec,nodev,ro,
# you need to PROVE WHY you need looser permissions.
# FIXME: this could probably be locked down even more.
# (e.g. -o ro /sys/kernel/security.)
#
# Q. How does systemd apply these?
#    https://alloc.cyber.com.au/task/task.php?taskID=30141
#
# A. If the mountpoint is in listed in this hard-coded table:
#      https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/main/src/shared/mount-setup.c#L64-L113
#    then systemd has *ALREADY MOUNTED IT*,
#    and systemd-remount-fs(8) simply runs "mount -o remount /foo".
#
#    Otherwise, systemd-fstab-generator(8) creates a .mount unit,
#    which is handled like any other systemd unit.
#
# Additional remarks:
#
#   * /run/live is to hide overlayfs's underlying components from inmates.
#     /lib/live/mount is the old path; as at Debian 11 both are still active.
#
#     NOTE: live-boot-hide-rootfs-components.sh now nerfs this better, but
#           nerf here as well in case of regressions.
#
#   * /var/tmp needs -orw for systemd-timesyncd (NTP client).
#   * /dev/shm needs -orw for chromium.
#   * /dev/shm needs >32M for libreoffice.
#   * /sys/fs/pstore is listed to add -oro (defense in depth).
#     UPDATE: pstore.ko is gone in inmate desktops.
#             Removed to appease systemd-remount-fs.service.
#             Adding "nofail" was not sufficient.
#             Is 0750 rwxr-x--- root:root on staff desktops;
#             this is sufficient; we needn't obsess over -o ro here.
#   * /dev is listed to add -onoexec.
#   * /proc -o subset=pid broke tinysshd.socket.
#   * /proc -o hidepid=invisible or =noaccess broke GUI login.
#   * FIXME: systemd-remount-fs(8) ignores mode=XXX.
